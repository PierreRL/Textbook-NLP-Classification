Computer_Science,504 Chapter 7 Large and Fast Exploiting Memory Hierarchy Size of Tags versus Set Associativity EXAMPLE Increasing associativity requires more comparators and more tag bits per cache block Assuming a cadle of 4K blocks a four word block size and a 32 bit ad dress find the total number of sets and the total number of tag bits for caches that are direct mapped two way and four way set associative and fullyassociative 4 ANSWER Since there are 16 2 bytes per block a 32 bit address yields 32 4 28 bits to be used for index and tag The direct mapped cache has the same number of sets as blocks and hence 12 bits of index since log2 4K 12 hence the total number of tag bits is 28 12 X4K 16 X4K 64 Kbits Each degree of associativity decreases the number of sets by a factor of two and thus decreases the number of bits used to index the cadle by one and increases the number of bits in the tag by one Thus for a two way set associative cache there are 2Ksets and the total number of tagbits is 28 11 X2x 2K 34 X2K 68 Kbits For a four way set associative cache the total number of sets is IK and the total number of tag bits is 28 10 X4 X IK 72 X IK 72 Kbits For a fully associative cache there is only one set with 4K blocks and the tag is 28 bits leading to a total of 28 X4K X I 11 2K tag bits Choosing Which Block to Replace When a miss occurs in a direct mapped cache the requested block can go in exactly one position and the block occupying that position must be replaced In an associative cache we have a choice of where to place the requested block and hence a choice of which block to replace In a fully associative cache all blocks are candidates for replacement In a set associative cache we must choose among the blocks in the selected set least recently used LRlJ A The most commonly used scheme is least recently used LRU which we used replacement scheme in which in the previous example In an LRU scheme The block replaced is the one that has the block replaced is the one been unused for the longest time LRU replacement is implemented by keeping that has been unused for the track of when each element in a set was used relative to the other elements in the longest time set For a two way set associative cache tracking when the two elements were used can be implemented by keeping a single bit in each set and setting the bit to indicate an element whenever that element is referenced As associativity increases implementing LRU gets harder in Section 7 5 we will see an alternative scheme for replacement ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science520.txt
Computer_Science,492 Chapter 7 Large and Fast Exploiting Memory Hierarchy Measuring and Improving Cache Performance In this section we begin by looking at how to measure and analyze cache perfor mance we then explore two different techniques for improving cache perfor mance One focuses on reducing the miss rate by reducing the probability that two different memory blocks will contend for the same cache location The sec ond technique reduces the miss penalty by adding an additional level to the hier archy This technique called multilevel caching first appeared in high end computers selling for over 1 00 000 in 1990 since then it has become common on desktop computers selling for less than 1000 CPU time can be divided into the clock cycles that the CPU spends executing the program and the clock cycles that the CPU spends wa iting for the memory system Normally we assume that the costs of cache accesses that are hits are part of the normal CPU execution cycles Thus CPU time CPU execution clock cycles Memory stall clock cycles x Clock cycle time The memory stall clock cycles come primarily from cache misses and we make that assumption here We also restrict the discussion to a simplified model of the memory system In real processors the stalls generated by reads and writes can be quite complex and accurate performance prediction usually requires very detailed simulations of the processor and memory system Memory stall clock cycles can be defined as the sum of the stall cycles coming from reads plus those coming from writes Memory stall clock cycles Read stall cycles Write stall cycles The read stall cycles can be defined in terms of the number of read accesses per program the miss penalty in clock cycles for a read and the read miss rate Read stall cycles Reads X Read miss rate X Read miss penalty Program Writes are more complicated For a write through scheme we have two sources of stalls write misses which usually require that we fetch the block before continu ing the write see the Elaboration on page 484 for more details on dealing with writes and write buffer stalls which occur when the write buffer is full when a write occurs Thus the cycles stalled for writes equals the sum of these two ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science508.txt

Computer_Science,438 Chapter 6 Enhancing Performance with Plpellnlng Clea rly this two issue processor can improve performance by up to a factor of 2 Doing so however requires that twice as many instructions be overlapped in execution and this additional overlap increases the relative performance loss from data and control hazards For example in our simple five stage pipeline loads have a use latency of 1 clock cycle which prevents one instruction from using the result without stalling In the two issue five stage pipeline the result of a load instruction cannot be used on the next clock cycle This means that the next two instructions cannot use the load result without stalling Furthermore ALU instructions that had no use latency in the simple five stage pipeline now have a one instruction use latency since the results cannot be used in the paired load or store To effectively exploit the parallelism available in a multiple issue processor more ambitious compiler or hardware scheduling techniques are needed and static multiple issue requires that the compiler takes on this role Simple Multiple ls5ue Code Scheduling How would this loop be scheduled on a static two issue pipeline for MIPS EXAMPLE Loop lw ItO O sl II tO array element addu t0 HO s2 II add scalar in s2 sw ItO O sl II store result addi sl sl 4 II decrement pointer bne sl zero Loop II branch sl O Reorder the instructions to avoid as many pipeline stalls as possible Assume branches are predicted so that control hazards are handled by the hardware The first three instructions have data dependences and so do the last two ANSWER Figure 6 46 shows the best schedule for these instructions Notice that just one pair of instructions has both issue slots used It takes 4 clocks per loop it eration at 4 clocks to execute 5 instructions we get the disappointing CPI of 0 8 versus the best case of 0 5 or an IPC of 1 25 versus 2 0 Notice that in computing CPI or IPC we do not count any nops executed as useful instruc tions Doing so would improve CPI but not performance loop unrolling A technique to get more performance from loops that access arrays in An important compiler technique to get more performance from loops is loop which multiple copies ofthe unrolling a technique where multiple copies of the loop body are made After loop body are made and instruc unrolling there is more ILP available by overlapping instructions from different tions from different iterations iterations are scheduled together ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science454.txt

Computer_Science,2 10 Translating and Starting a Program 109 compile and assemble each procedure independently so that a change to one line would require compiling and assembling only one procedure This alternative requires a new systems program called a link editor or linker whidl takes all the linker Also called link editor independently assembled machine language programs and stitdles them together A systems program that com bines independently assembled There are three steps for the linker machinelanguage programs and I Place code and data modules symbolically in memory resolves all undefined labels into an executable file 2 Determine the addresses of data and instruction labels 3 Patch both the internal and external references The linker uses the relocation information and symbol table in each object module to resolve all undefined labels Such references occur in branch instruc tions jump instructions and data addresses so the job of this program is much like that of an editor It finds the old addresses and replaces them with the new addresses Editing is the origin of the name link editor or linker for short The reason a linker makes sense is that it is much faster to patch code than it is to recompile and reassemble If all external references are resolved the linker next determines the memory locations each module will occupy Recall that Figure 2 17 on page 87 shows the MIPS convention for allocation of program and data to memory Since the files were assembled in isolation the assembler could not know where a module s instructions and data will be placed relative to other modules When the linker places a module in memory all absolute references that is memory addresses that are not relative to a register must be relocated to reflect its true location The linker produces an executable file that can be run on a computer Typi executable file A ti mctional cally this file has the same format as an object file except that it contains no unre program in the fonnat ofan object fIle that contains no unre solved references It is possible to have partially linked files such as library solved references relocation routines which still have unresolved addresses and hence result in object files information symbol table or debugging information Unking Object Files Link the two object files below Show updated addresses of the first few in EXAMPLE structions of the completed executable file We show the instructions in as sembly language just to make the example understandable in reality the instructions would be numbers Note that in the object files we have highlighted the addresses and symbols that must be updated in the link process the instructions that refer to the addresses of procedures A and B and the instructions that refer to the addresses of data words Xand Y ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science125.txt

Computer_Science,7 3 Measuring and Improving Cache Performance 507 The design considerations for a primary and secondary cache are significa ntly different because the presence of the other cache changes the best choice versus a single level cache In particular a two level cache structure allows the primary cache to focus on minimizing hit time to yield a shorter clock cycle while allow ing the secondary cache to focus on miss rate to reduce the penalty of long mem ory access times The interaction of the two caches permits such a focus The miss penalty of the primary cache is significantly reduced by the presence of the secondary cache allowing the primary to be smaller and have a higher miss rate For the secondary cache access time becomes less important with the presence of the primary cache since the access time of the secondary cache affects the miss penalty of the pri mary cache rather than directly affecting the primary cache hit time or the pro cessor cycle time The effect of these changes on the two caches can be seen by comparing each cache to the optimal design for a single level of cache In comparison to a single level cache the primary cache of a multilevel cache is often smaller Furthermore multilevel cache A memory the primary cache often uses a smaller block size to go with the smaller cache size hierarchy with multiple levels of caches rather than just a cache and reduced miss penalty In comparison the secondary cache will often be larger and main memory than in a single level cache since the access time of the secondary cache is less critical With a larger total size the secondary cache often will use a larger block size than appropriate with a single level cache In Chapter 2 we saw that Quicksort had an algorithmic advantage over Bubble Understanding Sort that could not be overcome by language or compiler optimization Figure Program 7 18 a shows instructions executed by item searched for Radix Sort versus Quick Performance sort Indeed for large arrays Radix Sort has an algorithmic advantage over quick sort in terms of number of operations Figure 7 18 b shows time per key instead of instructions executed We see that the lines start on the same trajectory as Fig ure 7 18 a but then the Radix Sort line diverges as the data to sort increases What is going on Figure 7 1 8 c answers by looking at the cache misses per item sorted Quicksort consistently has many fewer misses per item to be sorted Alas standard algorithmic analysis ignores the impact of the memory hierar chy As faster clock rates and Moore s law allow architects to squeeze all of the per formance out of a stream of instructions using the memory hierarchy well is critical to high performance As we said in the introduction understanding the behavior of the memory hierarchy is critical to understanding the performance of programs on today s computers ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science523.txt

Computer_Science,7 4 Virtual Memory 521 problems such as a never ending series of page faults which must be avoided How these problems are overcome is both very detailed and typically highly pro cessor specific In brief these problems are avoided by placing all the page tables in the address space of the operating system and placing at least some of the page tables for the system in a portion of main memory that is physically ad dressed and is always present and thus never on disk What about Writes The difference between the access time to the cache and main memory is tens to hundreds of cycles and write through schemes can be used although we need a write buffer to hide the latency of the write from the processor In a virtual mem ory system writes to the next level of the hierarchy disk take millions of proces sor clock cycles therefore building a write buffer to allow the system to write th rough to disk would be completely impractical Instead virtual memory sys tems must use write back performing the individual writes into the page in memory and copying the page back to disk when it is replaced in the memory This copying back to the lower level in the hierarchy is the source of the other name for this technique of handling writes namely copy back A write back scheme has another major advantage in a virtual memory system Hardware Because the disk transfer time is small compared with its access time copying Software back an entire page is much more efficient than writing individual words back to Interface the disk A write back operation although more efficient than transferring indi vidual words is still costly Thus we would like to know whether a page needs to be copied back when we choose to replace it To track whether a page has been written since it was read into the memory a dirty bit is added to the page table The dirty bit is set when any word in a page is written If the operating system chooses to replace the page the dirty bit indicates whether the page needs to be written out before its location in memory can be given to another page Making Address Translation Fast The TLB Since the page tables are stored in main memory every memory access by a program can take at least twice as long one memory access to obtain the physical address and a second access to get the data The key to improving access performance is to rely on locality of reference to the page table When a translation for a virtual page number is used it wiII probably be needed again in the near funlre because the references to the words on that page have both temporal and spatial locality ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science537.txt

Computer_Science,7 2 The Basics of Caches 479 The index of a cache block together with the tag contents of that block uniquely specifies the memory address of the word contained in the cache block Because the index field is used as an address to access the cache and because an n bit field has 2 values the total number of entries in a direct mapped cache must be a power of two In the MIPS architecnlfe since words are aligned to multiples of 4 bytes the least significant 2 bits of every address specify a byte within a word and hence are ignored when selecting the word in the block The total number of bits needed for a cache is a function of the cache size and the address size because the cache includes both the storage for the data and the tags The size of the block above was one word but normally it is several Assuming m the 32 bit byte address a direct mapped cache of size 2 blocks with 2 word m 2 2 _byte blocks will require a tag field whose size is 32 n m 2 bits because n bits are used for the index m bits are used for the word within the block and 2 bits are used for the byte part of the address The total number of bits in a direct mapped cache is 2 X block size tag size valid field size Since the block m m S size is 2 words 2 bits and the address size is 32 bits the number of bits in such a cache is 2 X m X32 32 1l 2 1 2 X m X32 31 1l 11 11 However the naming convention is to excludes the size of the tag and valid field and to count only the size of the data Bits in a Cache How many total bits are required for a direct mapped cache with 16 KB of EXAMPLE data and 4 word blocks assuming a 32 bit address 12 We know that 16 KB is 4K words which is 2 words and with a block size of ANSWER 2 10 4 words 2 2 blocks Each block has 4x 32 or 128 bits of data plus a tag which is 32 10 2 2 bits plus a valid bit Thus the total cache size is 210 X 128 32 1O 2 2 1 2lO x 147 147 Kbits or 18 4 KB for a 16 KB cache For this cache the total number of bits in the cache is about 1 1 5 times as many as needed just for the storage of the data ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science495.txt
Computer_Science,262 Chapter 4 Assessing and Understanding Performance increase One comparison that is particularly interesting is the SPEC CINT2000 and CFP2000 measurement divided by the clock rate in MHz The following tables summarizes the average value of this ratio across different clock rates for each processor Ratio Pentium III Pentium 4 CINT2000 Clock rate in MHz 0 47 0 36 CFP2000 Clock rate in MHz 0 34 0 39 Metrics such as benchmark performance divided by clock rate are sometimes thought of as measurements of implementation efficiency although as we have seen one cannot separate the interaction of clock rate and other improvements These measurements are particularly interesting because of the differences between the integer and floating point bendlmarks The CINT2000 performance ratios are typical when a faster version of a processor is introduced it may sacrifice one aspect of a design such as CPI to enhance another SUdl as clock rate Assuming one com piler for both processors and hence identical code the CINT2000 ratios tell us that the CPI of the Pentium 4 is 1 3 0 47 0 36 times that of the Pentium 3 How then ca n these numbers be reversed for the floating point benchmarks The answer is that the Pentium 4 provides a set of new instructions called the Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 see Chapter 3 that provide a significant boost for floating point Thus both the instruction count and the CPI for the Pentium 4 will differ from that of the Pentium 3 producing improved performance SPECweb99 A Throughput Benchmark for Web Servers In 1996 SPEC introduced its first benchmark designed to measure Web server performance the benchmark was superseded by a new version in 1999 SPECweb99 differs from SPEC CPU in a number of ways SPECweb99 focuses on throughput measuring the maximum number of connections that a system running as a Web server can support The system must provide response to a client request within a bounded time and with a bounded number of errors Because SPECweb99 measures throughput multiprocessors systems with more than one CPU are often used in benchmarks SPECweb99 provides only a program to generate Web server requests the Veb server software becomes part of the system being measured SPECweb99 performance depends on a wide measure of system characteris tics including the disk system and the network ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science278.txt

Computer_Science,520 Chapter 7 Large and Fast Exploiting Memory Hierarchy allows the page table to grow as a process consumes more space Thus the page table will only be large if the process is using many pages of virtual address space This technique requires that the address space expand in only one direction 2 Allowing growth in only one direction is not sufficient since most languages re quire two areas whose size is expandable one area holds the stack and the other area holds the heap Because of this duality it is convenient to divide the page table and let it grow from the highest address down as well as from the lowest address up This means that there will be two separate page tables and two sep arate limits The use of two page tables breaks the address space into two seg ments The high order bit of an address usually determines which segment and thus which page table to use for that address Since the segment is specified by the high order address bit each segment can be as large as one half of the ad dress space A limit register for each segment specifies the current size ofthe seg ment which grows in units of pages This type of segmentation is used by many architectures including MIPS Unlike the type of segmentation discussed in the Elaboration on page 514 this form of segmentation is invisible to the application program although not to the operating system The major disadvantage of this scheme is that it does not work well when the address space is used in a sparse fashion rather than as a contiguous set of virtual addresses 3 Another approach to reducing the page table size is to apply a hashing function to the virtual address so that the page table data structure need be only the size of the number of physical pages in main memory Such a structure is called an invert ed page table Of course the lookup process is slightly more complex with an in verted page table because we can no longer just index the page table 4 Multiple levels of page tables can also be used to reduce the total amount of page table storage The first level maps large fixed size blocks of virtual address space perhaps 64 to 256 pages in total These large blocks are sometimes called seg ments and this first level mapping table is sometimes called a segment table though the segments are invisible to the user Each entry in the segment table in dicates whether any pages in that segment are allocated and if so points to a page table for that segment Address translation happens by first looking in the segment table using the highest order bits of the address If the segment address is valid the next set of high order bits is used to index the page table indicated by the segment table entry This scheme allows the address space to be used in a sparse fashion multiple noncontiguous segments can be active without having to allocate the entire page table Such schemes are particularly useful with very large address spaces and in software systems that require noncontiguous allocation The primary disadvantage of this two level mapping is the more complex process for address translation 5 To reduce the actual main memory tied up in page tables most modern systems also allow the page tables to be paged Although this sounds tricky it works by using the same basic ideas of virtual memory and simply allowing the page tables to reside in the virtual address space In addition there are some small but critical,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science536.txt

Computer_Science,4 6 Concluding Remarks 271 We will use this equation and its constituent factors many times Remember though that individually the factors do not determine performance Only the product which equals execution time is a reliable measure of performance BIG Execution time is the only valid and unimpeachable measure of perfor The mance Many other metrics have been proposed and found wanting Picture Sometimes these metrics are flawed from the start by not reflecting exe cution time other times a metric valid in a limited context is extended and used beyond that context or without the additional clarification needed to make it valid Similarly any measure that summarizes performance should reflect execution time Weighted arithmetic means summarize performance while tracking execution time Through the use of weights a weighted arithmetic mean can adjust for different running times balancing the contribution of each benchmark to the summary Of course simply knowing this equation is not enough to guide the design or evaluation of a computer We must understand how the different aspects of a design affect each of these key parameters This insight involves a wide variety of issues from the effectiveness of the compiler to the effects of instruction set design on instruction count to the impact of pipelining and memory systems on CPl to the interaction between the technology and organization that determine the clock rate The art of computer design and evaluation lies not in plugging numbers into a performance equation but in accurately determining how alter natives will affect performance and cost Most computer users care about both cost and performance Vhile under standing the relationship among aspects of a design and its performance is chal lenging determining the cost of various design features is often a more difficult problem The cost of a computer is affected not only by the cost of the compo nents but by the costs of labor to assemble the computer of research and develop ment overhead of sales and marketing and of the profit margin Finally because of the rapid change in implementation technologies the most cost effective choice today is often suboptimal in six months or a year Computer designs will always be measured by cost and performance as well as other important factors such as power reliability cost of ownership and scalabil ity Although this chapter has focused on perfo rmance the best designs will strike the appropriate balance for a given market among all these factors ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science287.txt
Computer_Science,4 5 Fallacies and Pitfalls 267 The execution time of the program after I make the improvement is given by the following simple equation known as Amdahl s law Amdahl s law A rule stating that the performance Execution time after improvement enhancement possible with a given improvement is limited by Execution time affected by improvement Execution time unaffected the amount that the improved Amount of improvement feature is used For this problem Execution time after improvement 80 seconds 100 _ 80 seconds n Since we want the performance to be five times faster the new execution time should be 20 seconds giving 20 seconds 80 seconds 20 seconds 80 seconds 0 n That is there is no amOll1lt by which we can enhance multiply to achieve a fivefold increase in performance if multiply accounts for only 80 of the workload The performance enhancement possible with a given improvement is limited by the amount that the improved feature is used This concept also yields what we call the law of diminishing returns in everyday life e can use Amdahl s law to estimate performance improvements when we know the time consumed for some function and its potential speed up Amdahl s law together with the CPU performance equation are handy tools for evaluating potential enhancements Amdahl s law is explored in more detail in the exercises II and in the In More Depth Amdal s Law on the CD A common theme in hardware design is a corollary of Amdahl s law Make the common case fast This simple guideline reminds us that in many cases the fre quency with which one event occurs may be much higher than another Amdahl s law reminds us that the opportunity for improvement is affected by how much time the event consumes Thus making the common case fast will tend to enhance performance better than optimizing the rare case Ironically the com mon case is often simpler than the rare case and hence is often easier to enhance Pitfall Using a subset ofthe performance equation as a performance metric We have already shown the fallacy of predicting performance based on simply one of clock rate instruction count or CPI Another common mistake is to use two of the three factors to compare performance Although using two of the three factors may be valid in a limited context it is also easily misused Indeed nea rly all pro posed alternatives to the use of time as the performance metric have led evennlally to misleading claims distorted results or incorrect interpretations ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science283.txt

Computer_Science,510 Chapter 7 Large and Fast Exploiting Memory Hierarchy Check Which of the following is generally true about a design with multiple levels of Yourself caches 1 First level caches are more concerned about hit time and second level caches are more concerned about miss rate 2 First level caches are more concerned about rate and second level iniSS caches are more concerned about hit time Summary In this section we focused on three topics cache performance using associativity to reduce miss rates and the use of multilevel cache hierarchies to reduce miss penalties Since the total number of cycles spent on a program is the sum of the processor cycles and the memory stall cycles the memory system can have a significant effect on program execution time In fact as processors get faster by lowering CPI or by increasing the clock rate or both the relative effect of the memory stall cycles increases making good memory systems critical to achieving high performance The number of memory stall cycles depends on both the miss rate and the miss penalty The challenge as we will see in Section 7 5 is to reduce one of these factors without significantly affecting other critical factors in the memory hierarchy To reduce the miss rate we examined the use of associative placement schemes Such schemes can reduce the miss rate of a cache by allowing more flexible place ment of blocks within the cache Fully associative schemes allow blocks to be placed anywhere but also require that every block in the cache be searched to sat isfy a request This search is usually implemented by having a comparator per cache block and searching the tags in parallel The cost of the comparators makes large fully associative caches impractical Set associative caches are a practical alter native since we need only search am ong the elements of a unique set that is cho sen by indexing Set associative caches have higher miss rates but are fa ster to access The amount of associativity that yields the best performance depends on both the technology and the details of the implementation Finally we looked at multilevel caches as a technique to reduce the miss pen alty by allowing a larger secondary cache to handle misses to the primary cache Second level caches have become commonplace as designers find that limited silicon and the goals of high clock rates prevent primary caches from becoming large The secondary cache which is often 10 or more times larger than the pri mary cache handles many accesses that miss in the primary cache In such cases the miss penalty is that of the access time to the secondary cache typically 10 processor cycles versus the access time to memory typically 100 proces sor cycles As with associativity the design trade offs between the size of the,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science526.txt
Computer_Science,516 Chapter 7 Large and Fast Exploiting Memory Hierarchy Hardware The page table together with the program counter and the registers specifies the state of a program If we want to allow another program to use the processor we Software must save this state Later after restoring this state the program ca n continue Interface execution lVe often refer to this state as a process The process is considered active when it is in possession of the processor otherwise it is considered inactive The operating system can make a process active by loading the process s state includ ing the program counter which will initiate execution at the value of the saved program counter The process s address space and hence all the data it can access in memory is defined by its page table which resides in memory Rather than save the entire page table the operating system simply loads the page table register to point to the page table of the process it wants to make active Each process has its own page table since different processes use the same virtual addresses The operating sys tem is responsible for allocating the physical memory and updating the page tables so that the virtual address spaces of different processes do not collide Ai we will see shortly the use of separate page tables also provides protection of one process from another Figure 7 2 1 uses the page table register the virtual address and the indicated page table to show how the hardware can form a physical address A valid bit is used in each page table entry just as we did in a cache If the bit is off the page is not present in main memory and a page fault occurs If the bit is on the page is in memory and the entry contains the physical page number Because the page table contains a mapping for every possible virtual page no tags are required In cache terminology the index that is used to access the page table consists of the full block address which is the virtual page number Page Faults If the valid bit for a virtual page is off a page fault occurs The operating system must be given control This transfer is done with the exception mechanism which we discuss later in this section Once the operating system gets control it must find the page in the next level of the hiera rchy usually magnetic disk and decide where to place the requested page in main memory The virtual address alone does not immediately tell us where the page is on disk Returning to our library analogy we cannot find the location of a library book on the shelves just by knowing its title Instead we go to the catalog and look up the book obtaining an address for the location on the shelves such as the Library of Congress call number Likewise in a virnlal memory system we must keep track of the location on disk of each page in virtual address space ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science532.txt

Computer_Science,7 1 Introduction 469 you brought out the book on ea rly English computers to find out about EDSAC you also noticed that there was another book shelved next to it about early mechanical computers so you also brought back that book too and later on found something useful in that book Books on the same topic are shelved together in the library to increase spatial locality We ll see how spatial locality is used in memory hierarchies a little later in this chapter Just as accesses to books on the desk naturally exhibit locality locality in pro grams arises from simple and natural program structures For example most pro grams contain loops so instructions and data are likely to be accessed repeatedly showing high amounts of temporal locality Since instructions are normally accessed sequentially programs show high spatial locality Accesses to data also exhibit a natural spatial locality For example accesses to elements of an array or a record will naturally have high degrees of spatial locality We take advantage of the principle of locality by implementing the memory of a computer as a memory hierarchy A memory hierarchy consists of multiple lev memory hierarchy A struc els of memory with different speeds and sizes The faster memories are more ture that uses multiple levels of memories as the distance from expensive per bit than the slower memories and thus smaller the CPU increases the size of Today there are three primary technologies used in building memory hierar the memories and the access chies Main memory is implemented from DRAM dynamic random access time both increase memory while levels closer to the processor caches use SRAM static random access memory DRAM is less costly per bit than SRAM although it is substan tially slower The price difference arises because DRAM uses significantly less area per bit of memory and DRAMs thus have larger capacity for the same amount of silicon the speed difference arises from several factors described in Section B 8 of Appendix B The third technology used to implement the largest and slowest level in the hierarchy is magnetic disk The access time and price per bit vary widely among these technologies as the table below shows using typical values for 2004 Memory technology typical access time per GB In 2004 SRAM 0 5 5 ns 4000 10 000 DRAM 50 70 ns 100 200 Magnetic disk 5 OOO CX O 20 X OOO ns 0 5Q 2 Because of these differences in cost and access time it is advantageous to build memory as a hierarchy of levels Figure 7 1shows the faster memory is close to the processor and the slower less expensive memory is below it The goal is to present the user with as much memory as is available in the cheapest technology while providing access at the speed offered by the fastest memory ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science485.txt

Computer_Science,6 8 Exceptions 431 With five instructions active in any clock cycle the challenge is to associate an exception with the appropriate instruction Moreover multiple exceptions can occur simultaneously in a single clock cycle The normal solution is to prioritize the exceptions so that it is easy to determine which is serviced first this strategy works for pipelined processors as well In most MIPS implementations the hard ware sorts exceptions so that the earliest instruction is interrupted I O device requests and hardware malfunctions are not associated with a spe cific instruction so the implementation has some flexibility as to when to inter rupt the pipeline Hence using the mechanism used for other exceptions works just fine The EPC captures the address of the interrupted instructions and the MIPS Cause register records all possible exceptions in a clock cycle so the exception software must match the exception to the instruction An important clue is know ing in which pipeline stage a type of exception ca n occur For exa mple an unde fined instruction is discovered in the 10 stage and invoking the operating system occurs in the EX stage Exceptions are collected in the Cause register so that the hardware can interrupt based on later exceptions once the earliest one has been serviced The hardware and the operating system must work in conjunction so that excep Hardware tions behave as you would expect The hardware contract is normally to stop the Software offending instruction in midstream let all prior instructions complete flush all Interface following instructions set a register to show the cause of the exception save the address of the offending instruction and then jump to a prearranged address The operating system contract is to look at the cause of the exception and act appro priately For an undefined instruction hardware failure or arithmetic overflow exception the operating system normally kills the program and returns an indica tor of the reason For an I O device request or an operating system service call the operating system saves the state of the program performs the desired task and at some point in the future restores the program to continue execution In the case of I O device requests we may often choose to run another task before resuming the task that requested the I O since that task may often not be able to proceed until the I O is complete This is why the ability to save and restore the state of any task is critical One of the most important and frequent uses of exceptions is han dling page faults and TLB exceptions Chapter 7 describes these exceptions and their handling in more detail ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science447.txt

Computer_Science,5 5 A Multleyele Implementation 319 ticycle datapath If we compare Figure 5 25 to the datapath for the single cycle ver sion in Figure 5 11 on page 300 we can see the following differences A single memory unit is used for both instructions and data There is a single ALU rather than an ALU and two adders One or more registers are added after every major functional unit to hold the output of that unit until the value is used in a subsequent clock cycle At the end of a clock cycle all data that is used in subsequent clock cycles must be stored in a state element Data used by 5lIbsequent instructions in a later clock cycle is stored into one of the progra mmer visible state elements the register file the PC or the memory In contrast data used by the same instruction in a later cycle must be stored into one of these additional registers Thus the position of the additional registers is determined by the two fa ctors what combinational units will fit in one clock cycle and what data are needed in later cycles implementing the instruction In this multicycle design we assume that the clock cycle can accommodate at most one of the following operations a memory access a register file access two reads or one write or an ALU opera tion Hence any data produced by one of these three functional units the mem ory the register file or the ALU must be saved into a temporary register for use on a later cycle If it were not saved then the possibility of a timing race could occur leading to the use of an incorrect value The following temporary registers are added to meet these requirements The Instruction register IR and the Memory data register MDR are added to save the output of the memory for an instruction read and a data read respectively Two separate registers are used since as will be clear shortly both values are needed during the same clock cycle The A and B registers are used to hold the register operand values read from the register file The ALUOut register holds the output of the ALU All the registers except the IR hold data only between a pair of adjacent clock cycles and will thus not need a write control signal The IR needs to hold the instruction until the end of execution of that instruction and thus will require a write control signal This distinction will become more clear when we show the individual clock cycles for each instruction Because several functional units are shared for different purposes we need both to add multiplexors and to expand existing multiplexors For example since one memory is used for both instructions and data we need a multiplexor to select between the two sources for a memory address namely the PC for instruc tion access and ALUOut for data access ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science335.txt

Computer_Science,468 Chapter 7 Large and Fast Exploiting Memory Hierarchy Introduction From the earliest days of computing programmers have wanted unlimited amounts of fast memory The topics we will look at in this chapter aid program mers by creating the illusion of unlimited fast memory Before we look at how the illusion is actually created let s consider a simple analogy that illustrates the key principles and mechanisms that we lise Suppose you were a student writing a term paper on important historical developments in computer hardwa re You are sitting at a desk in a library with a collection of books that you have pulled from the shelves and are examining You find that several of the important computers that you need to write about are described in the books you have but there is nothing about the EDSAC There fore you go back to the shelves and look for an additional book You find a book on early British computers that covers EDSAC Once you have a good selection of books on the desk in front of you there is a good probability that many of the top ics you need can be found in them and you may spend most of your time just using the books on the desk without going back to the shelves Having several books on the desk in front of you saves time compared to having only one book there and constantly having to go back to the shelves to return it and take out another The same principle allows us to create the illusion of a large memory that we can access as fast as a very small memory Just as you did not need to access all the books in the library at once with equal probability a program does not access all of its code or data at once with equal probability Otherwise it would be impossi ble to make most memory accesses fast and still have large memory in computers just as it would be impossible for you to fit all the library books on your desk and still find what you wanted quickly This principle oflocality underlies both the way in which you did your work in the library and the way that programs operate The principle of locality states that temporal locality The princi programs access a relatively small portion of their address space at any instant of ple stating that ifa data location time just as you accessed a very small portion of the library s collection There are is referenced then it will tend to two different types of locality be referenced again soon Temporal locality locality in time If an item is referenced it will tend to be referenced again soon If you recently brought a book to your desk to spatial locality The locality look at you will probably need to look at it again soon principle stating that if a data location is referenced data loca Spatial locality locality in space If an item is referenced items whose tions with nearby addresses will addresses are close by will tend to be referenced soon For example when tend to be referenced soon ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science484.txt

Computer_Science,3 9 Concluding Remarks 225 Concluding Remarks Computer arithmetic is distinguished from paper and pencil arithmetic by the constraints of limited precision This limit may result in invalid operations through calculating numbers larger or smaller than the predefined limits Such anomalies called overflow or underflow may result in exceptions or inter rupts emergency events similar to unplanned subroutine calls Chapter 5 dis cusses exceptions in more detail Floating point arithmetic has the added challenge of being an approximation of real numbers and care needs to be taken to ensure that the computer number selected is the representation closest to the actual number The challenges of imprecision and limited representation are part of the inspiration for the field of numerical analysis Over the years computer arithmetic has become largely standardized greatly enhancing the portability of programs Two s complement binary integer arith metic and IEEE 754 binary floating point arithmetic are found in the vast major ity of computers sold today For example every desktop computer sold since this book was first printed follows these conventions A side effect of the stored program computer is that bit patterns have no inher ent meaning The same bit pattern may represent a signed integer unsigned inte ger floating point number instruction and so on It is the instruction that operates on the word that determines its meaning With the explanation of computer arithmetic in this chapter comes a descrip tion of much more of the MIPS instruction set One point of confusion is the instructions covered in these chapters versus instructions executed by MIPS chips versus the instructions accepted by MIPS assemblers The next two figures try to make this clear Figure 3 24 lists the MIPS instructions covered in this chapter and Chapter 2 We call the set of instructions on the left hand side of the figure the MIPS core The instructions on the right we call the MIPS arithmetic core On the left of Fig ure 3 25 are the instructions the MIPS processor executes that are not found in Figure 3 24 We call the full set of hardware instructions MIPS J2 On the right of Figure 3 25 are the instructions accepted by the assembler that are not part of MIPS 32 We call this set of instructions Pseudo MIPS ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science241.txt

Computer_Science,264 Chapter 4 Assessing and Understanding Performance design of processors for laptops Battery capacity has improved only slightly over time with the major improvements coming from new m aterials Hence the abil ity of the processor to operate efficiently and conserve power is crucial To save power techniques ranging from putting parts of the computer to sleep to reduc ing clock rate and voltage have all been used In fact power consumption is so impo rtant that Intel has designed a line of processors the Pentium M series spe cifically fo r mobile battery powered applications As we discussed in Chapter 1 for CMOS technology we can reduce power by reducing frequency Hence recent processors intended fo r laptop use all have the ability to adapt frequency to reduce power consumption simultaneously of course reducing perfo rmance Thus adequately evaluating the energy efficiency of a processor requires examining its performance at maximum power at an intermediate level that conserves battery life and at a level that maximizes battery life In the Intel Mobile Pentium and Pentium M lines there are two available clock rates m aximum and a reduced clock rate The best performance is obtained by running at maximum speed the best battery life by running always at the reduced rate and the intermediate performance power optimized level by switching dynamically between these two clock rates Figure 4 8 shows the performance of three Intel Pentium processors designed fo r use in mobile applications running SPEC CINT2000 and SPEC CFP2000 as benchmarks As we can see the newest processor the Pentium M has the best performance when run a full clock speed as well as with the adaptive clock rate mode The Pentium M s 600 MHz clock makes it slower when run in minimum power mode than the Pentium 4 M but still faster than the older Pentium lIl M design For power limited applications the m ost important m etric is probably energy efficiency which is computed by taking perfo rmance and dividing by average power consumption when running the benchmark Figure 4 9 shows the relative energy efficiency fo r these processors running the SPEC2000 bench marks This data clearly shows the energy efficiency advantage of the newer Pen tium M design In all three modes it has a significant advantage in energy efficiency over the mobile versions of the Pentium III and Pentium 4 Notice that the Pentium 4 M has only a slight efficiency advantage over the Pentium llI M This data clearly shows the adva ntage of a processor like the Pentium M which is designed for reduced power usage from the start as opposed to a design like the Pentium llI M or Pentium 4 M which are modified versions of the standard processors Of course adequately measuring energy efficiency also requires the use of additional benchmarks designed to reflect how users employ battery powered com puters Both PC review magazines and Intel s technical journal regularly undertake such studies ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science280.txt

Computer_Science,7 4 Virtual Memory 515 of segmentation is to support more powerful methods of protection and sharing in an address space Most operating system textbooks contain extensive discussions of seg mentation compared to paging and of the use of segmentation to logically share the address space The major disadvantage of segmentation is that it splits the address space into logically separate pieces that must be manipulated as a two part address the segment number and the offset Paging in contrast makes the boundary between page number and offset invisible to programmers and compilers Segments have also been used as a method to extend the address space without changing the word size of the computer Such attempts have been unsuccessful because of the awkwardness and performance penalties inherent in a two part address of which programmers and compilers must be aware Many architectures divide the address space into large fixed size blocks that sim plify protection between the operating system and user programs and increase the effi ciency of implementing paging Although these divisions are often called segments this mechanism is much simpler than variable block size segmentation and is not visi ble to user programs we discuss it in more detail shortly Placing a Page and Finding It Again Because of the incredibly high penalty for a page fault designers reduce page fault frequency by optimizing page placement If we allow a virtual page to be mapped to any physical page the operating system can then choose to replace any page it wants when a page fault occurs For example the operating system can use a sophisticated algorithm and complex data structures which track page usage to try to choose a page that will not be needed for a long time The ability to use a clever and flexible replacement scheme reduces the page fault rate and simplifies the use of fully associative placement of pages As mentioned in Section 7 3 the difficulty in using fully associative place ment is in locating an entry since it can be anywhere in the upper level of the hierarchy A full search is impractical In virtual memory systems we locate pages by using a table that indexes the memory this structure is called a page page table The table contain table and resides in memory A page table is indexed with the page number ing the virtual to physical address translations in a virnlal from the virtual address to discover the corresponding physical page number memory system The table Each program has its own page table which maps the virtual address space of which is stored in memory is that program to main memory In our library analogy the page table corre typically indexed by the virtual sponds to a mapping between book titles and library locations Just as the card page number each entry in the catalog may contain entries for books in another library on campus rather than table contains the physical page the local branch library we will see that the page table may contain entries for number for that virtual page if pages not present in memory To indicate the location of the page table in mem the page is currently in memory ory the hardware includes a register that points to the start of the page table we call this the page table register Assume for now that the page table is in a fixed and contiguous area of memory ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science531.txt
Computer_Science,7 3 Measuring and Improving Cache Performance 509 Elaboration Multilevel caches create several complications First there are now several different types of misses and corresponding miss rates In the example on page 499 we saw the primary cache miss rate and the global miss rate the fraction global m iss rate The fraction of references that missed in all cache levels There is also a miss rate for the second ofreferences that miss in all lev ary cache which is the ratio of all misses in the secondary cache divided by the num e1s ofa multilevel cache ber of accesses This miss rate is called the local miss rate of the secondary cache Because the primary cache filters accesses especially those with good spatial and local m iss rate The fraction of temporal locality the local miss rate of the secondary cache is much higher than the references to one level ofa cache that miss used in multilevel global miss rate For the example on page 499 we can compute the local miss rate of hierarchies the secondary cache as 0 5 2 25 Luckily the global miss rate dictates how often we must access the main memory Additional complications arise because the caches may have different block sizes to match the larger or smaller total size Likewise the associativity of the cache may change On chip caches are often built with associativity of four or higher while off chip caches rarely have associativity of greater than two On chip Ll caches tend to have lower associativity than one chip L2 caches since fast hit time is more important for Ll caches These changes in block size and associativity introduce complications in the modeling of the caches which typically mean that all levels need to be simulated together to understand the behavior Elaboration With out of order processors performance is more complex since they execute instructions during the miss penalty Instead of instruction miss rate and data miss rates we use misses per instruction and this formula Memory stall cycles _ Misse s X Total miss latency Overlapped miss latency Instruction Instruction There is no general way to calculate overlapped miss latency so evaluations of memory hierarchies for out of order processors inevitably require simulation of the pro cessor and memory hierarchy Only by seeing the execution of the processor during each miss can we see if the processor stalls waiting for data or simply finds other work to do A guideline is that the processor often hides the miss penalty for an Ll cache miss that hits in the L2 cache but it rarely hides a miss to the L2 cache Elaboration The performance challenge for algorithms is that the memory hierarchy varies bet een different implementations of the same architecture in cache size asso ciativity block size and number of caches To copy with such variability some recent numerical libraries parameterize their algorithms and then search the parameter space at runtime to find the best combination for a particular computer ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science525.txt

Computer_Science,1 2 Below Your Program 13 The first programmers communicated to computers in binary numbers but this was so tedious that they quickly invented new notations that were closer to the way humans think At first these notations were translated to bill3ry by hand but this process was still tiresome Using the machine to help program the machine the pioneers invented programs to translate from symbolic notation to binary The first of these programs was named an assembler This program trans assembler A program that lates a symbolic version of an instruction into the binary version For example the translates a symbolic version of instructions into the binary ver programmer would write sion add A S and the assembler would translate this notation into 1000110010100000 This instruction tells the computer to add the two numbers A and B The name coined for this symbolic langll3ge still used today is assembly language assembly language A sym Although a tremendous improvement assembly language is still far from the bolic representation of machine instructions notation a scientist might like to use to simulate fluid flow or that an accountant might use to balance the books Assembly language requires the programmer to write one line for every instruction that the machine will follow forcing the pro grammer to think like the machine The recognition that a program could be written to translate a more powerful language into computer instructions was one of the great breakthroughs in the early days of computing Programmers today owe their productivity and their sanity to the creation of high level programming languages and compilers that high level programming translate programs in such languages into instructions language A portable language A compiler enables a programmer to write this high level language expression such as C Fortran or Java com posed of words and algebraic A B notation that can be translated by a compiler into assembly The compiler would compile it into this assembly language statement language add A S The assembler would translate this statement into the binary instruction that tells the computer to add the two numbers Aand S 1000110010100000 Figure 1 4 shows the relationships among these programs and languages High level programming langll3ges offer several important benefits First they allow the programmer to think in a more natural language using English words and algebraic notation resulting in programs that look much more like text than like tables of cryptic symbols see Figure 1 4 Moreover they allow languages to,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science29.txt

Computer_Science,6 9 Advanced Plpellnlng Extracting More Performance 435 use when the speculation was incorrect In hardwa re speculation the processor usually buffers the speculative results until it knows they are no longer speculative If the speculation was correct the instructions are completed by allowing the con tents of the buffers to be written to the registers or memory If the speculation was incorrect the hardware flushes the buffers and reexecutes the correct instruction sequence Speculation introduces one other possible problem speculating on certain instructions may introduce exceptions that were formerly not present For exam ple suppose a load instruction is moved in a speculative manner but the address it uses is not legal when the speculation is incorrect The result would be that an exception that should not have occurred will occur The problem is complicated by the fact that if the load instruction were not speculative then the exception must occur In compiler based speculation such problems are avoided by adding special speculation support that allows such exceptions to be ignored until it is clear that they really should occur In hardware based speculation exceptions are simply buffered until it is clear that the instruction causing them is no longer speculative and is ready to complete at that point the exception is raised and nor mal exception handling proceeds Since speculation can improve performance when done properly and decrease performance when done carelessly significant effort goes into deciding when it is appropriate to speculate Later in this section we will examine both static and dynamic techniques for speculation Static Multiple Issue Static multiple issue processors all use the compiler to assist with packaging instructions and handling hazards In a static issue processor you can think of the set of instructions that issue in a given clock cycle which is called an issue packet issue packet The set of instruc as one large instruction with multiple operations This view is more than an anal tions that issues together in 1 clock cycle the packet maybe ogy Since a static multiple issue processor usually restricts what mix of instruc determined statically by the tions can be initiated in a given clock cycle it is useful to think of the issue packet compiler or dynamically by the as a single instruction allowing several operations in certain predefined fields processor This view led to the original name for this approach Very Long Instruction Word VLIW The Intel IA 64 architecture uses this approach which it calls by its own name Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computer EPIC The Itanium and Itanium 2 processors available in 2000 and 2002 respectively are the first implementa tions of the IA 64 architecture Most static issue processors also rely on the compiler to take on some respon sibility for handling data and control hazards The compiler s responsibilities may include static branch prediction and code scheduling to reduce or prevent all haza rds ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science451.txt
Computer_Science,5 5 A Multleyele Implementation 321 Because the datapath shown in Figure 5 26 takes multiple clock cycles per instruction it will require a different set of control signals The programmer visible state units the PC the memory and the registers as well as the lR will need write control signals The memory will also need a read signal We can use the ALU con II trol unit from the single cycle datapath see Figure 5 13 and Appendix C to control the ALU here as well Finally each of the two input multiplexors requires a single control line while the four input multiplexor requires two control lines Figure 5 27 shows the datapath of Figure 5 26 with these control lines added The multicycle datapath still requires additions to support branches and jumps after these additions we will see how the instructions are sequenced and then generate the datapath control With the jump instruction and branch instruction there are three possible sources for the value to be written into the PC 1 The output of the ALU which is the value PC 4 during instruction fetch This value should be stored directly into the pc 2 The register ALUOut which is where we will store the address of the branch target after it is computed 3 The lower 26 bits of the Instruction register OR shifted left by two and concatenated with the upper 4 bits of the incremented PC which is the source when the instruction is a jump As we observed when we implemented the single cycle control the PC is written both unconditionally and conditionally During a normal increment and for jumps the PC is written unconditionally If the instruction is a condi tional branch the incremented PC is replaced with the value in ALUOut only if the two designated registers are equal Hence our implementation uses two sepa rate control signals PCWrite which causes an unconditional write of the PC and PCWriteCond which causes a write of the PC if the branch condition is also true We need to connect these two control signals to the PC write control Just as we did in the single cycle datapath we will use a few gates to derive the PC write con trol signal from PCWrite PCWriteCond and the Zero signal of the ALU which is used to detect if the two register operands of a beq are equal To determine whether the PC should be written during a conditional branch we AND together the Zero signal of the ALU with the PCWriteCond The output of this AND gate is then ORed with PCWrite which is the unconditional PC write signal The output of this OR gate is connected to the write control signal for the Pc Figure 5 28 shows the complete multicycle datapath and control unit includ ing the additional control signals and multiplexor for implementing the PC updating ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science337.txt

Computer_Science,2 11 How Compliers Optimize 119 Programmers concerned about performance of critical loops especially in real Understanding time or embedded applications often find themselves staring at the assembly lan Program guage produced by a compiler and wondering why the compiler failed to perform Performance some global optimization or to allocate a variable to a register throughout a loop The answer often lies in the dictate that the compiler be conservative The oppor tunity for improving the code may seem obvious to the programmer but then the programmer often has knowledge that the compiler does not have such as the absence of aliasing between two pointers or the absence of side effects by a func tion call The compiler may indeed be able to perform the transformation with a little help which could eliminate the worst case behavior that it must assume This insight also illustrates an important observation programmers who use pointers to try to improve performance in accessing variables especially pointers to values on the stack that also have names as variables or as elements of arrays are likely to disable many compiler optimizations The end result is that the lower level pointer code may run no better or perhaps even worse than the higher level code optimized by the compiler Compilers must be conservative The first task of a compiler is to produce correct code its second task is usually to produce fast code although other fac tors such as code size may sometimes be important as well Code that is fast but incorrect for any possible combination of inputs is simply wrong Thus when we say a compiler is conservative we mean that it performs an optimiza tion only if it knows with 100 certainty that no matter what the inputs the code will perform as the user wrote it Since most compilers translate and opti mize one function or procedure at a time most compilers especially at lower optimization levels assume the worst about function calls and about their own parameters Global Code Optimizations Many global code optimizations have the same aims as those used in the local case including common subexpression elimination constant propagation copy propagation and dead store and dead code elimination There are two other important global optimizations code motion and induc tion variable elimination Both are loop optimizations that is they are aimed at code in loops Code motion finds code that is loop invariant a particular piece of code computes the same value on every loop iteration and hence may be com puted once outside the loop Induction variable elimination is a combination of,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science135.txt

Computer_Science,434 Chapter 6 Enhancing Performance with Plpellnlng There are two primary and distinct responsibilities that must be dealt with in a multiple issue pipeline issue slots The positions from I Packaging instructions into issue slots How does the processor determine which instructions could issue how many instructions and which instructions can be issued in a given in a given clock cycle by analogy clock cycle In most static issue processors this process is at least partially these correspond to positions at handled by the compiler in dynamic issue designs it is normally dealt with the starting blocks for a sprint at runtime by the processor although the compiler will often have already tried to help improve the issue rate by placing the instructions in a benefi cial order 2 Dealing with data and control hazards In static issue processors some or all of the consequences of data and control hazards are handled statically by the compiler In contrast most dynamic issue processors attempt to allevi ate at least some classes of hazards using hardware techniques operating at execution time Although we describe these as distinct approaches in reality techniques from one approach are often borrowed by the other and neither approach can claim to be perfectly pure The Concept of Speculation One of the most important methods for finding and exploiting more ILP is specu speculation An approach lation Speculation is an approach that allows the compiler or the processor to whereby the compiler or proces guess about the properties of an instruction so as to enable execution to begin sor guesses the outcome of an for other instructions that may depend on the speculated instruction For exa m instruction to remove it as a ple we might speculate on the outcome of a branch so that instructions after the dependence in executing other branch could be executed earlier Or we might speculate that a store that precedes instructions a load does not refer to the same address which would allow the load to be exe cuted before the store The difficulty with speculation is that it may be wrong So any speculation mechanism must include both a method to check if the guess was right and a method to unroll or back out the effects of the instructions that were executed speculatively The implementation of this back out capability adds com plexity to any processor supporting speculation Speculation may be done in the com piler or by the hardwa re For example the compiler can use speculation to reorder instructions moving an instruction across a branch or a load across a store The processor hardware ca n perform the sa me transformation at runtime using techniques we discuss later in this section The recovery mechanisms used for incorrect speculation are rather different In the case of speculation in software the compiler usually inserts additional instruc tions that check the accuracy of the speculation and provide a fix up routine to,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science450.txt

Computer_Science,240 Chapter 4 Assessing and Understanding Performance Introduction This chapter discusses how to measure report and summarize performance and describes the major factors that determine the performance of a computer A pri mary reason for examining performance is that hardware performance is often key to the effectiveness of an entire system of hardware and software Much of the material in this chapter especially this section and the next will be critical to understanding the next three chapters The rest of the chapter provides important insights and principles that anyone seeking to evaluate the performance of a com puter system should know The material in Sections 4 3 4 5 however is not nec essary for the immediately following chapters and can be returned to later Assessing the performance of such a system can be quite challenging The scale and intricacy of modern software systems together with the wide range of perfor mance improvement techniques employed by hardware designers have made per formance assessment much more difficult It is simply impossible to sit down with an instruction set manual and a significant software system and determine simply by analysis how fast the software will run on the computer In fact for different types of applications different performance metrics may be appropriate and dif ferent aspects of a computer system may be the most significant in determining overall performance Of course in trying to choose among different computers performance is almost always an important attribute Accurately measuring and comparing dif ferent computers is critical to purchasers and therefore to designers The people selling computers know this as well Often salespeople would like you to see their computer in the best possible light whether or not this light accurately reflects the needs of the purchaser s application In some cases claims are made about com puters that don t provide useful insight for any real applications Hence under standing how best to measure performance and the limitations of performance measurements is important in selecting a computer Our interest in performance however goes beyond issues of assessing performance only from the outside of a computer To understand why a piece of software performs as it does why one instruction set can be implemented to per form better than another or how some hardware feature affects performance we need to understand what determines the performance of a computer For exa m ple to improve the performance of a software system we may need to understand what factors in the hardware contribute to the overall system performance and the relative importance of these factors These factors may include how well the pro gram uses the instructions of the computer how well the underlying hardware,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science256.txt
Computer_Science,514 Chapter 7 Large and Fast Exploiting Memory Hierarchy portion The number of bits in the page offset field determines the page size The number of pages addressable with the virtual address need not match the number of pages addressable with the physical address Having a larger number of virtual pages than physical pages is the basis for the illusion of an essentially unbounded amount of virtual memory Many design choices in virtual memory systems are motivated by the high cost of a miss which in virtual memory is traditionally called a page fault A page fault will take millions of clock cycles to process The table on page 469 shows that main memory is about 100 000 times faster than disk This enormous miss pen alty dominated by the time to get the first word for typical page sizes leads to sev eral key decisions in designing virtual memory systems Pages should be large enough to try to amortize the high access time Sizes from 4 KB to 16 KB are typical today New desktop and server systems are being developed to support 32 KB and 64 KB pages but new embedded sys tems are going in the other direction to 1 KB pages Organizations that reduce the page fault rate are attractive The primary tech nique used here is to allow fully associative placement of pages in memory Page faults can be handled in software because the overhead will be small compared to the disk access time In addition software can afford to use clever algorithms for choosing how to place pages because even small reduc tions in the miss rate will pay for the cost of such algorithms Write through will not work for virtual memory since writes take too long Instead virtual memory systems use write back The next few subsections address these factors in virtual memory design Elaboration Although we normally think of virtual addresses as much larger than physical addresses the opposite can occur when the processor address size is small rel ative to the state of the memory technology No single program can benefit but a collec tion of programs running at the same time can benefit from not having to be swapped to memory or by running on parallel processors Given that Moore s law applies to DRAM 32 bit processors are already problematic for servers and soon for desktops segmentation A variable size Elaboration The discussion of virtual memory in this book focuses on paging which address mapping scheme in uses fixed size blocks There is also a variable size block scheme called segmentation which an address consists oft O In segmentation an address consists of two parts a segment number and a segment parts a segment number which offset The segment register is mapped to a physical address and the offset is added is mapped to a physical address to find the actual physical address Because the segment can vary in size a bounds and a segment offset check is also needed to make sure that the offset is within the segment The major use,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science530.txt

Computer_Science,578 Chapter 8 The key insight to reduce this overhead is that parity is simply a sum of infor mation by watching which bits change when we write the new information we need only change the corresponding bits on the parity disk Figure 8 7 shows the shortcut We must read the old data from the disk being written compare old data to the new data to see which bits change read the old parity change the corre sponding bits then write the new data and new parity Thus the small write involves four disk accesses to two disks instead of accessing all disks This organi zation is RAID 4 Distributed Block Interleaved Parity RAID 5 RAID 4 efficiently supports a mixture of large reads large writes and small reads plus it allows small writes One drawback to the system is that the parity disk must be updated on every write so the parity disk is the bottleneck for back to back writes To fix the parity write bottleneck the parity information can be spread throughout all the disks so that there is no single bottleneck for writes The dis tributed parity organization is RAID 5 Figure 8 8 shows how data are distributed in RAID 4 versus RAID 5 As the organization on the right shows in RAID 5 the parity associated with each row of data blocks is no longer restricted to a single disk This orga nization allows multi ple writes to occur simultaneously as long as the parity blocks are not located to the sa me disk For example a write to block 8 on the right must also access its par ity block P2 thereby occupying the first and third disks A second write to block 5 on the right implying an update to its parity block PI accesses the second and fourth disks and thus could occur concurrently with the write to block 8 Those sa me writes to the organization on the left result in changes to blocks PI and P2 both on the fifth disk which is a bottleneck P Q Redundancy RAID 6 Parity based schemes protect against a single self identifying failure When a single failure correction is not sufficient parity can be generalized to have a second calcu lation over the data and another check disk of information This second check block allows recovery from a second failure Thus the storage overhead is twice that of RAID 5 The small write shortcut of Figure 8 7 works as well except now there are six disk accesses instead of four to update both P and Q information RAID Summary RAID I and RAID 5 are widely used in servers one estimate is 80 of disks in servers are found in some RAID system One weakness of the RAID systems is repair First to avoid making the data ull3vailable during repair the array must be designed to allow the failed disks to,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science594.txt

Computer_Science,3 6 Floating Point 215 Since the worst case for rounding would be when the actual number is halfway between two floating point representations accuracy in floating point is normally measured in terms of the number of bits in error in the least significant bits of the significand the measure is called the number of units in the last place or ulp If a units in the last place number was off by 2 in the least significant bits it would be called off by 2 ulps ulp The number ofbits in error in the least significant bits Provided there is no overflow underflow or invalid operation exceptions IEEE ofthe significand between the 754 guarantees that the computer uses the number that is within one half ulp actual number and the number that can be prepresented Elaboration Although the example above really needed just one extra digit multiply can need two A binary product may have one leading 0 bit hence the normalizing step must shift the product 1 bit left This shifts the guard digit into the least significant bit of the product leaving the round bit to help accurately round the product There are four rounding modes always round up toward 0 always round down toward 0 truncate and round to nearest even The final mode determines what to do if the number is exactly halfway in between The Internal Revenue Service always rounds 0 50 dollars up possibly to the benefit of the IRS A more equitable way would be to round up this case half the time and round down the other half IEEE 754 says that if the least significant bit retained in a halfway case would be odd add one if it s even truncate This method always creates a 0 in the least significant bit in the tie breaking case giving the rounding mode its name This mode is the most commonly used and the only one that Java supports The goal of the extra rounding bits is to allow the computer to get the same results as if the intermediate results were calculated to infinite precision and then rounded To support this goal and rounding to the nearest even the standard has a third bit in addition to guard and round it is set whenever there are nonzero bits to the right of the round bit This sticky bit allows the computer to see the difference between sticky bit A bit used in round 0 50 OOten and 0 50 01 when rounding ing in addition to guard and ten round that is set whenever there The sticky bit may be set for example during addition when the smaller number is 1 2 are nonzero bits to the right of shifted to the right Suppose we added 5 0iten x 10 to 2 34ten x 10 in the example the round bit above Even with guard and round we would be adding 0 0050 to 2 34 with a sum of 2 3450 The sticky bit would be set since there are nonzero bits to the right Without the sticky bit to remember whether any ls were shifted off we would assume the num ber is equal to 2 345000 00 and round to the nearest even of 2 34 With the sticky bit to remember that the number is larger than 2 345000 00 we round instead to 2 35 Summary The Big Picture below reinforces the stored program concept from Chapter 2 the meaning of the information cannot be determined just by looking at the bits for the same bits can represent a variety of objects This section shows that computer arithmetic is finite and thus can disagree with natural arithmetic For example the IEEE 754 standard floating point representation _I s X I Fraction X2 Exponent bias ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science231.txt
Computer_Science,7 5 A Common Framework for Memory Hierarchies 541 mapped caches because of their advantage in access time and simplicity The advantage in access time occurs because finding the requested block does not depend on a comparison Such design choices depend on many details of the implementation such as whether the cache is on chip the technology used for implementing the cache and the critical role of cache access time in determining the processor cycle time Question 3 Which Block Should Be Replaced on a Cache Miss When a miss occurs in an associative cache we must decide which block to replace In a fully associative cache all blocks are candidates for replacement If the cache is set associative we must choose among the blocks in the set Of course replacement is easy in a direct mapped cache because there is only one candidate We have already mentioned the two primary strategies for replacement in set associative or fully associative caches Random Candidate blocks are randomly selected possibly using some hardware assistance For example MIPS supports random replacement for TLB misses Least recently used LRU The block replaced is the one that has been unused for the longest time In practice LRU is too costly to implement for hierarchies with more than a small degree of associativity two to four typically since tracking the usage information is costly Even for four way set associativity LRU is often approxi mated for example by keeping track of which of a pair of blocks is LRU which requires 1 bit and then tracking which block in each pair is LRU which requires 1 bit per pair For larger associativity either LRU is approximated or random replacement is used In caches the replacement algorithm is in hardware which means that the scheme should be easy to implement Random replacement is simple to build in hardware and for a two way set associative cache random replacement has a miss rate about 1 1 times higher than LRU replacement As the caches become larger the miss rate for both replacement strategies falls and the absolute differ ence becomes small In fact random replacement can sometimes be better than the simple LRU approximations that are easily implemented in hardware In virtual memory some form of LRU is always approximated since even a tiny reduction in the miss rate can be important when the cost of a miss is enormous Reference bits or equivalent fun ctionality is often provided to make it easier for the operating system to track a set of less recently used pages Because misses are,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science557.txt

Computer_Science,3 6 Floating Point 209 One issue that computer designers face in supporting floating point arithmetic is Hardware whether to use the same registers used by the integer instructions or to add a spe Software cial set for floating point Because programs normally perform integer operations Interface and floating point operations on different data separating the registers will only slightly increase the number of instructions needed to execute a program The major impact is to create a separate set of data transfer instructions to move data between floating point registers and memory The benefits of separate floating point registers are having twice as many registers without using up more bits in the instruction format having twice the register bandwidth by having separate integer and floating point register sets and being able to customize registers to floating point for example some computers convert all sized operands in registers into a single internal format Compiling a Floating Point C Program into MIPS Assembly Code Let s convert a temperanlfe in Fahrenheit to Celsius EXAMPLE f loa t f2c f loa t f ahr I r et ur n 5 0 9 0l f ah r 32 0 J Assume that the floating point argument f ah r is passed in fl2 and the result should go in f O Unlike integer registers floating point register 0 can contain a number What is the MIPS assembly code We assume that the compiler places the three floating point constants in ANSWER memory within easy reach of the global pointer gpoThe first two instruc tions load the constants 5 0 and 9 0 into floating point registers f 2c l weI f16 eons t 5 gp f16 5 0 5 0 1n memory l weI f18 eons t 9 gp f18 9 0 9 0 1n memory ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science225.txt

Computer_Science,376 Chapter 6 Enhancing Performance with Plpellnlng Data Hazards data hazard Also called pipe Data hazards occur when the pipeline must be stalled because one step must wait line data hazard An occurrence for another to complete Suppose you found a sock at the folding station for in which a planned instruction which no match existed One possible strategy is to run down to your room and cannot execute in the proper search through your clothes bureau to see if you can find the match Obviously clock cycle because data that is while you are doing the search loads that have completed drying and are ready to needed to exeUite the instruc fold and those that have finished washing and are ready to dry must wait tion is not yet available In a computer pipeline data hazards arise from the dependence of one instruc tion on an earlier one that is still in the pipeline a relationship that does not really exist when doing laundry For example suppose we have an add instruction fol lowed immediately by a subtract instruction that uses the sum sO add sO tO t1 sub tZ sO t3 Without intervention a data hazard could severely stall the pipeline The add instruction doesn t write its result until the fifth stage meaning that we would have to add three bubbles to the pipeline Although we could try to rely on compilers to remove all such hazards the results would not be satisfactory These dependences happen just too often and the delay is just too long to expect the compiler to rescue us from this dilemma The primary solution is based on the observation that we don t need to wait for forwarding Also called the instruction to complete before trying to resolve the data hazard For the code bypassing A method of resolving a data hazard by sequence above as soon as the ALU creates the sum for the add we can supply it retrieving the missing data as an input for the subtract Adding extra hardware to retrieve the missing item element from internal buffers early from the internal resources is called forwarding or bypassing rather than waiting for it to arrive from programmer visible registers or memory Forwarding with Two Instructions For the two instructions above show what pipeline stages would be con EXAMPLE nected by forwarding Use the drawing in Figure 6 4 to represent the datapath during the five stages of the pipeline Align a copy of the datapath for each instruction similar to the laundry pipeline in Figure 6 1 Figure 6 5 shows the connection to forward the value in sO after the execu ANSWER tion stage of the add instruction as input to the execution stage of the su b in struction In this graphical representation of events forwarding paths are valid only if the destination stage is later in time than the source stage For example there cannot be a valid fonva rding path from the output of the memory access stage in the first,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science392.txt

Computer_Science,6 4 Data Hazards and Forwarding 407 of the pipeline register during the EX and MEM stages determines if RegWrite is asserted Also MIPS requires that every use of 0 as an operand must yield an operand value of zero In the event that an instruction in the pipeline has 0 as its destination for example sll 0 1 2 we want to avoid forwarding its possibly nonzero result value Not forwarding results destined for 0 frees the assembly programmer and the compiler of any requirement to avoid using 0 as a destina tion The conditions above thus work properly as long we add EXlMEM Regis terRd 0 to the first hazard condition and MEM WB RegisterRd 0 to the 01 second Now that we can detect hazards half of the problem is resolved but we must still forward the proper data Figure 6 29 shows the dependences between the pipeline registers and the inputs to the ALU for the same code sequence as in Figure 6 28 The change is that the dependence begins from a pipeline register rather than wa iting for the WB stage to write the register file Thus the required data exists in time for later instructions with the pipeline registers holding the data to be forwarded If we can take the inputs to the ALU from allY pipeline register rather than just ID EX then we can forward the proper data By adding multiplexors to the input of the ALU and with the proper controls we can run the pipeline at full speed in the presence of these data dependences For now we will assume the only instructions we need to forward are the four R format instructions add sub and and or Figure 6 30 shows a close up of the ALU and pipeline register before and after adding forwarding Figure 6 3 1 shows the values of the control lines for the ALU multiplexors that select either the register file values or one of the forwarded values This forwarding control will be in the EX stage because the ALU forwarding multiplexors are found in that stage Thus we must pass the operand register numbers from the ID stage via the ID EX pipeline register to determine whether to forward values We already have the rt field bits 20 16 Before forwarding the ID EX register had no need to include space to hold the rs field Hence rs bits 25 2 1 is added to ID EX Let s now write both the conditions for detecting hazards and the control sig nals to resolve them I E X hazard if EX MEM RegWrite and EX MEM RegisterRd 0 and EX MEM RegisterRd ID EX RegisterRsll ForwardA 10 if EX MEM RegWrite and EX MEM RegisterRd 0 and EX MEM RegisterRd ID EX RegisterRtll ForwardS 10,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science423.txt
Computer_Science,6 6 Branch Hazards 421 Dynamic Branch Prediction Assuming a branch is not taken is one simple form of branch prediction In that case we predict that branches are untaken flushing the pipeline when we are wrong For the simple five stage pipeline such an approach possibly coupled with compiler based prediction is probably adequate With deeper pipelines the branch penalty increases when measured in clock cycles Similarly with multiple issue the branch penalty increases in terms of instructions lost This combination means that in an aggressive pipeline a simple static prediction scheme will proba bly waste too much performance As we mentioned in Section 6 1 with more hard wa re it is possible to try to predict branch behavior during program execution One approach is to look up the address of the instruction to see if a branch was taken the last time this instruction was executed and if so to begin fetching new instructions from the same place as the last time This technique is called dynamic dynamic branch branch prediction prediction Prediction of branches at runtime using run One implementation of that approach is a branch prediction buffer or branch time information history table A branch prediction buffer is a small memory indexed by the lower portion of the address of the branch instruction The memory contains a bit that branch prediction buffer says whether the branch was recently taken or not Also called branch history table A small memory that is This is the simplest sort of buffer we don t know in fact if the prediction is the indexed by the lower portion of right one it may have been put there by another branch that has the same low the address of the branch order address bits But this doesn t affect correctness Prediction is just a hint that instruction and that contains is assumed to be correct so fetching begins in the predicted direction If the hint one or more bits indicating turns out to be wrong the incorrectly predicted instructions are deleted the pre whether the branch was recently diction bit is inverted and stored back and the proper sequence is fetched and taken or not executed This simple I bit prediction scheme has a performance shortcoming even if a branch is almost always taken we will likely predict incorrectly twice rather than once when it is not taken The following example shows this dilemma Loops and Prediction EXAMPLE Consider a loop branch that branches nine times in a row then is not taken once What is the prediction accuracy for this branch assuming the predic tion bit for this branch remains in the prediction buffer ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science437.txt

Computer_Science,540 Chapter 7 Large and Fast Exploiting Memory Hierarchy shrinks significantly The potential disadvantages of associativity as we men tioned earlier are increased cost and slower access time Question 2 How Is a Block Found The choice of how we locate a block depends on the block placement scheme since that dictates the number of possible locations We can summarize the schemes as follows Associativity location method Comparisons required Direct mapped index 1 Set associative index the set 5eilR h among elements degree of associativity Full 5eilR h all cache entries size of the cache separate lookup table 0 The choice among direct mapped set associative or fully associative mapping in any memory hierarchy will depend on the cost of a miss versus the cost of implementing associativity both in time and in extra hardware Including the L2 cache on the chip enables much higher associativity because the hit times are not as critical and the designer does not have to rely on standard SRAM chips as the building blocks Fully associative caches are prohibitive except for small sizes where the cost of the comparators is not overwhelming and where the absolute miss rate improvements are greatest In virtual memory systems a separate mapping table the page table is kept to index the memory In addition to the storage required for the table using an index table requires an extra memory access The choice of full associativity for page placement and the extra table is motivated by four facts I Full associativity is beneficial since misses are very expensive 2 Full associativity allows software to use sophisticated replacement schemes that are designed to reduce the miss rate 3 The full map can be easily indexed with no extra hardware and no search ing required 4 The large page size means the page table size overhead is relatively small The use of a separate lookup table like a page table for virnlal memory is not practical for a cache because the table would be much larger than a page table and could not be accessed quickly Therefore virtual memory systems almost always use fully associative placement Set associative placement is often used for caches and TLBs where the access combines indexing and the search of a small set A few systems have used direct ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science556.txt

Computer_Science,8 4 Buses and other Connections between Processors Memory and i O Devlc es 581 Buses and Other Connections between Processors Memory and I O Devices In a computer system the various subsystems must have interfaces to one another For example the memory and processor need to communicate as do the proces sor and the I O devices For many years this has been done with a bus A bus is a shared communication link which uses one set of wires to connect multiple sub systems The two major advantages of the bus organization are versatility and low cost By defining a single connection scheme new devices ca n easily be added and peripherals can even be moved between computer systems that use the same kind of bus Furthermore buses are cost effective because a single set of wires is shared in multiple ways The major disadvantage of a bus is that it creates a communication bottleneck possibly limiting the maximum I O throughput When I O must pass through a single bus the bandwidth of that bus limits the maximum I O throughput Designing a bus system capable of meeting the demands of the processor as well as connecting large numbers of I O devices to the machine presents a major chal lenge One reason bus design is so difficult is that the maximum bus speed is largely limited by physical factors the length of the bus and the number of devices These physical limits prevent us from running the bus arbitrarily fast In addition the need to support a range of devices with widely varying latencies and data transfer rates also makes bus design challenging As it becomes difficult to run many parallel wires at high speed due to clock skew and reflection the industry is in transition from parallel shared buses to high speed serial point to point interconnections with switches Thus such net works are gradually replacing buses in our systems As a result of this transition this section has been revised in this edition to emphasize the general problem of connecting I O devices processors and mem ory rather than focus exclusively on buses Bus Basics Classically a bus generally contains a set of control lines and a set of data lines The control lines are used to signal requests and acknowledgments and to indi cate what type of information is on the data lines The data lines of the bus carry information between the source and the destination This information may con sist of data complex commands or addresses For example if a disk wa nts to write some data into memory from a disk sector the data lines will be used to indicate the address in memory in which to place the data as well as to carry the,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science597.txt

Computer_Science,552 Chapter 7 Large and Fast Exploiting Memory Hierarchy Pitfall Extending an address space by adding segments on top ofan unsegmented address space During the 1970s many programs grew so large that not all the code and data could be addressed with just a 16 bit address Computers were then revised to offer 32 bit addresses either through an unsegmented 32 bit address space also called a flat address space o r by adding 16 bits of segment to the existing 16 bit address From a marketing point of view adding segments that were program mer visible and that forced the programmer and compiler to decompose pro grams into segments could solve the addressing problem Unfo rtunately there is trouble any time a programming language wants an address that is larger than one segment such as indices for large arrays unrestricted pointers or reference parameters Moreover adding segments can turn every address into two words one for the segment number and one for the segment offset causing problems in the use of addresses in registers Given the size of DRAMs and Moore s law many of today s 32 bit systems are facing similar problems Concluding Remarks The difficulty of building a memory system to keep pace with faster processors is underscored by the fact that the raw material for main memory DRAMs is essen tially the same in the fastest computers as it is in the slowest and cheapest Figure 7 36 compares the memory hierarchy of microprocessors aimed at desktop server and embedded applications The L1 caches are similar across applications with the primary differences being L2 cache size die size processor clock rate and instructions issued per clock It is the principle of locality that gives us a chance to overcome the long latency of memory access and the soundness of this strategy is demonstrated at all levels of the memory hierarchy Although these levels of the hierarchy look quite differ ent in quantitative terms they follow similar strategies in their operation and exploit the same properties of locality Because processor speeds continue to improve faster than either DRAM access times or disk access times memory will increasingly be the factor that limits per formance Processors increase in performance at a high rate and DRAMs are now doubling their density about every two years The access time of DRAMs however is improving at a much slower rate less than 10 per year Figure 7 37 plots pro cessor performance aga inst a 7 annual performance improvement in DRAM latency Vhile latency improves slowly recent enhancements in DRAM technol ogy double data rate DRAMs and related techniques have led to greater,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science568.txt

Computer_Science,6 1 An Overview of Plpellnlng 375 second stage In an instruction set like the IA 32 where instructions va ry from I byte to 17 bytes pipelining is considerably more challenging As we saw in Chap ter 5 all recent implementations of the IA 32 architecture acnlally translate IA 32 instructions into simple microoperations that look like MIPS instructions As we will see in Section 6 10 the Pentium 4 actually pipelines the microoperations rather than the native IA 32 instructions Second MIPS has only a few instruction formats with the source register fields being located in the same place in each instruction This symmetry means that the second stage can begin reading the register file at the same time that the hardwa re is determining what type of instruction was fetched If MIPS instruction formats were not symmetric we would need to split stage 2 resulting in six pipeline stages We will shortly see the downside of longer pipelines Third memory operands only appear in loads or stores in MIPS This restric tion means we can use the execute stage to calculate the memory address and then access memory in the following stage If we could operate on the operands in memory as in the IA 32 stages 3 and 4 would expand to an address stage mem ory stage and then execute stage Fourth as discussed in Chapter 2 operands must be aligned in memory Hence we need not worry about a single data transfer instruction requiring two data memory accesses the requested data can be transferred between processor and memory in a single pipeline stage Pipeline Hazards There are situations in pipelining when the next instruction cannot execute in the following clock cycle These events are called hazards and there are three different types Structural Hazards The first hazard is called a structural hazard It means that the hardware cannot structural hazard An occur support the combination of instructions that we want to execute in the same clock rence in which a planned instruction cannot execute in cycle A structural hazard in the laundry room would occur if we used a washer the proper clock cycle bemuse dryer combination instead of a separate washer and dryer or if our roommate was the hardware mnnot support busy doing something else and wouldn t put clothes away Our carefully scheduled the combination of instructions pipeline plans would then be foiled that are set to execute in the As we said above the MIPS instruction set was designed to be pipelined mak given clock cycle ing it fairly easy for designers to avoid structural hazards when designing a pipe line Suppose however that we had a single memory instead of two memories If the pipeline in Figure 6 3 had a fourth instruction we would see that in the same clock cycle that the first instruction is accessing data from memory while the fourth instruction is fetching an instruction from that same memory Without two memories our pipeline could have a strucnlfal hazard ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science391.txt

Computer_Science,48 Chapter 2 Instructions Language of the Computer Introduction To command a computer s hardware you must speak its language The words of a computer s language are called instructions and its vocabulary is called an instruction set The vocabu instruction set In this chapter you will see the instruction set of a real computer lary ofcommands understood both in the form written by humans and in the form read by the computer We by a given architecnlre introduce instructions in a top down fashion Starting from a notation that looks like a restricted programming language we refine it step by step until you see the real language of a real computer Chapter 3 continues our downward descent unveiling the representation of integer and floating point numbers and the hard ware that operates on them You might think that the languages of computers would be as diverse as those of humans but in reality computer languages are quite similar more like regional dialects than like independent languages Hence once you learn one it is easy to pick up others This similarity occurs because all computers are constructed from hardware technologies based on similar underlying principles and because there are a few basic operations that all computers must provide Moreover computer designers have a common goal to find a language that makes it easy to build the hardware and the compiler while maximizing performance and minimizing cost This goal is time honored the following quote was written before you could buy a computer and it is as true today as it was in 1947 It is easy to see by formal logical methods that there exist certain instrllction sets that are in abstract adequate to control and calise the execution ofany se quence ofoperations The really decisive considerations from the present point ofview in selecting an instrllction set are more ofa practical nattlre simplicity ofthe equipment demanded by the instruction set and the clarity ofits application to the actually important problems together with the speed ofits handling ofthose problems Burks Goldstine and yon Neumann 1947 The simplicity of the equipment is as valuable a consideration for com put ers of the 2oo0s as it was for those of the 1950s The goal of this chapter is to teach an instruction set that follows this advice showing both how it is repre sented in hardware and the relationship between high level programming lan guages and this more primitive one Our examples are in the C programming language Section 2 14 shows how these would change for an object oriented language like Java ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science64.txt

Computer_Science,418 Chapter 6 Enhancing Performance with Plpellnlng Assume Branch Not Taken As we saw in Section 6 1 stalling until the branch is complete is too slow A com mon improvement over branch stalling is to assume that the branch will not be taken and thus continue execution down the sequential instruction stream If the branch is taken the instructions that are being fetched and decoded must be dis carded Execution continues at the branch target If branches are untaken half the time and if it costs little to discard the instructions this optimization halves the cost of control hazards To discard instructions we merely change the original control values to Os much as we did to stall for a load use data hazard The difference is that we must also change the three instructions in the IF 10 and EX stages when the branch reaches the MEM stage for load use stalls we just changed control to 0 in the 10 stage and let them percolate through the pipeline Disca rding instructions then flush instructions To dis means we must be able to flush instructions in the IF 10 and EX stages of the card instructions in a pipeline pipeline usually due to an unexpected event Reducing the Delay of Branches One way to improve branch performance is to reduce the cost of the taken branch Thus far we have assumed the next PC for a branch is selected in the MEM stage but if we move the branch execution earlier in the pipeline then fewer instruc tions need be flushed The MIPS architecture was designed to support fast single cycle branches that could be pipelined with a small branch penalty The designers observed that many branches rely only on simple tests equality or sign fo r exam pie and that such tests do not require a full ALU operation but can be done with at most a few gates When a more complex branch decision is required a separate instruction that uses an ALU to perform a comparison is required a situation that is similar to the use of condition codes for branches Moving the branch decision up requires two actions to occur earlier comput ing the branch target address and evaluating the branch decision The easy part of this change is to move up the branch address calculation We already have the PC value and the immediate field in the IFIl O pipeline register so we just move the branch adder from the EX stage to the 10 stage of course the branch target address calculation will be performed for all instructions but only used when needed The harder part is the branch decision itself For branch equal we would com pare the two registers read during the 10 stage to see if they are equal Equality can be tested by first exclusive DRing their respective bits and then DRing all the results Moving the branch test to the 1D stage implies additional forwarding and hazard detection hardware since a branch dependent on a result still in the pipe line must still work properly with this optimization For example to implement branch on equal and its inverse we will need to forward results to the equality test logic that operates during 10 There are two complicating factors ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science434.txt

Computer_Science,330 Chapter 5 The Processor Datapath and Control Defining the Control Now that we have determined what the control signals are and when they must be asserted we can implement the control unit To design the control unit for the single cycle datapath we used a set of truth tables that specified the setting of the control signals based on the instruction class For the multicycle datapath the control is more complex because the instruction is executed in a series of steps The control for the multicycle datapath must specify both the signals to be set in any step and the next step in the sequence II In this subsection and in Section 5 7 we will look at two different techniques to specify the control The first technique is based on finite state machines that are microprogram A symbolic usually represented graphically The second technique called microprogramming representation ofcontrol in the uses a programming representation for control Both of these techniques repre fann ofinstructions called sent the control in a form that allows the detailed implementation using gates microinstructions that are exe ROMs or PLAs to be synthesized by a CAD system In this chapter we will cuted on a simple micromachine focus on the design of the control and its representation in these two forms II Section 5 8 shows how hardware design languages are used to design modern processors with examples of both the multicycle datapath and the finite state control In modern digital systems design the final step of taking a hardware description to actual gates is handled by logic and datapath synthesis tools Appendix C shows how this process operates by translating the multicycle control unit to a detailed hardware implementation The key ideas of control can be grasped from this chapter without II examining the material in either ll Section 5 8 or Appendix C However if you II want to actually do some hardware design Section 5 9 is useful and Appendix C can show you what the implementations are likely to look like at the gate level Given this implementation and the knowledge that each state requires 1 clock cycle we can find the CPI for a typical instruction mix CPI in a Multicycle CPU EXAMPLE Using the SPECINT2000 instruction mix shown in Figure 3 26 what is the CPI assuming that each state in the multicycle CPU requires 1 clock cycle ANSWER The mix is 25 loads I load byte 24 load word 10 stores i sto re byte 9 store word 11 branches 6 beq 5 bne 2 jumps 1 j a1 1 j r and 52 ALU all the rest of the mix which we assume to be ALU instructions From Figure 5 30 on page 329 the number of clock cycles for each instruction class is the following ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science346.txt

Computer_Science,8 9 Fallacies and Pitfalls 607 or are unattainable because of other system limitations For example in quoting bus performance the peak transfer rate is sometimes specified using a memory system that is impossible to build For networked systems the software overhead of initiating communication is ignored The 32 bit 33 MHz PCI bus has a peak bandwidth of about 133 MB sec In practice even for long transfers it is difficult to sustain more than about 80 MB sec for realistic memory systems As mentioned above users of wireless net works typically achieve only about a third of the peak bandwidth Amdahl s law also reminds us that the throughput of an I O system will be lim ited by the lowest performance component in the I O path Fallacy Magnetic disk storage is on its last legs and will be replaced shortly This is both a fallacy and a pitfall Such claims have been made constantly for the past 20 years though the string of failed alternatives in recent years seems to have reduced the level of claims for the death of magnetic storage Among the unsuc cessful contenders are magnetic bubble memories optical storage and holo graphic storage None of these systems has matched the combination of characteristics that favor magnetic disks high reliability nonvolatility low cost reasonable access time and rapid improvement Magnetic storage technology continues to improve at the same or faster pace that it has sustained over the past 25 yea rs Pitfall Using magnetic tapes to back lip disks Once again this is both a fallacy and a pitfall Magnetic tapes have been part of computer systems as long as disks because they use similar technology as disks and hence historically have followed the same density improvements The historic cost performance difference between disks and tapes is based on a sealed rotating disk having lower access time than sequen tial tape access but removable spools of magnetic tape mean many tapes can be used per reader and they can be very long and so have high capacity Hence in the past a single magnetic tape could hold the contents of many disks and since it was 10 to 100 times cheaper per gigabyte than disks it was a useful backup medium The claim was that magnetic tapes must track disks since innovations in disks must help tapes This claim was important because tapes were a small market and could not afford a separate large research and development effort One reason the market is small is that desktop owners generally do not back up disks onto tape and so while desktops are by far the largest market for disks desktops are a small market for tapes Alas the larger market has led disks to improve much more quickly than tapes Starting in 2000 to 2002 the largest popular disk was larger than the largest popu lar tape In that same time frame the price per gigabyte of ATA disks dropped below that of tapes Tape apologists now claim that tapes have compatibility requirements that are not imposed on disks tape readers must read or write the current and previous generation of tapes and must read the last four generations,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science623.txt

Computer_Science,6 6 Branch Hazards 419 I During 10 we must decode the instruction decide whether a bypass to the equality unit is needed and complete the equality comparison so that if the instruction is a branch we can set the PC to the branch target address For warding for the operands of branches was formerly handled by the ALU forwarding logic but the introduction of the equality test unit in ID wiII require new forwarding logic Note that the bypassed source operands of a branch can come from either the ALU MEM or MEM WB pipeline latches 2 Because the values in a branch comparison are needed during 10 but may be produced later in time it is possible that a data hazard can occur and a stall will be needed For example if an ALU instruction immediately pre ceding a branch produces one of the operands for the comparison in the branch a stall will be required since the EX stage for the ALU instruction will occur after the ID cycle of the branch Despite these difficulties moving the branch execution to the 10 stage is an improvement since it reduces the penalty of a branch to only one instruction if the branch is taken namely the one currently being fetched The exercises explore the details of implementing the forwarding path and detecting the hazard To flush instructions in the IF stage we add a control line called IEFlush that zeros the instruction field of the IFIID pipeline register Clearing the register transforms the fetched instruction into a nop an instruction that has no action and changes no state Pipelined Branch Show what happens when the branch is taken in this instruction sequence EXAMPLE assuming the pipeline is optimized for branches that are not taken and that we moved the branch execution to the 10 stage 36 sub la 4 8 40 beq 1 3 7 PC relative branch t o 40 4 7 4 72 44 and 12 2 5 48 or 13 2 6 52 add 1 4 4 2 56 slt 15 6 7 72 l w 14 50 171 Figure 6 38 shows what happens when a branch is taken Unlike Figure 6 37 ANSWER there is only one pipeline bubble on a taken branch ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science435.txt

Computer_Science,5 6 Exceptions 341 or external we use the term interrtlpt only when the event is externally caused The Intel IA 32 architecture uses the word interrupt for all these events Interrupts were initially created to handle unexpected events like arithmetic overflow and to signal requests for service from I O devices The same basic mechanism was extended to handle internally generated exceptions as well Here are some examples showing whether the situation is generated internally by the processor or externally generated Type of event From where MIPS terminology I O device request Extemal Interrupt Invoke the operating system from user program Internal Exception Arithmetic overflow Internal Exception Using an undefined instruction Internal Exception Hardware malfunctions Either Exception or interrupt Many of the requirements to support exceptions come from the specific situa tion that causes an exception to occur Accordingly we will return to this topic in Chapter 7 when we discuss memory hierarchies and in Chapter 8 when we dis cuss li D and we better understand the motivation for additional capabilities in the exception mechanism In this section we deal with the control implementa tion for detecting two types of exceptions that arise from the portions of the instruction set and implementation that we have already discussed Detecting exceptional conditions and taking the appropriate action is often on the critical timing path of a machine which determines the clock cycle time and thus performance Without proper attention to exceptions during design of the control unit attempts to add exceptions to a complicated implementation can significantly reduce performance as well as complicate the task of getting the design correct How Exceptions Are Handled The two types of exceptions that our current implementation can generate are execution of an undefined instruction and an arithmetic overflow The basic action that the machine must perform when an exception occurs is to save the address of the offending instruction in the exception program counter EPC and then transfer control to the operating system at some specified address The operating system can then take the appropriate action which may involve providing some service to the user program taking some predefined action in response to an overflow or stopping the execution of the program and reporting an error After performing whatever action is required because of the exception the operating system can terminate the program or may con tinue its execution using the EPC to determine where to restart the execution,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science357.txt

Computer_Science,528 Chapter 7 Large and Fast Exploiting Memory Hierarchy latency When a cache miss occurs however the processor needs to translate the address to a physical address so that it can fetch the cache block from main memory When the cache is accessed with a virtual address and pages are shared between programs which may access them with different virtual addresses there is the possi aliasing A situation in which bility of aliasing Aliasing occurs when the same object has two names in this case the same object is accessed by two virtual addresses for the same page This ambiguity creates a problem because a two addresses can occur in vir word on such a page may be cached in two different locations each corresponding to tual memorywhen there are two different virtual addresses This ambiguity would allow one program to write the data virtual addresses for the same without the other program being aware that the data had changed Completely virtually physical page addressed caches either introduce design limitations on the cache and TLB to reduce aliases or require the operating system and possibly the user to take steps to ensure that aliases do not occur Figure 7 24 assumed a 4 KB page size but it s really 16 KB The lntrinsity FastMATH uses such a memory system organization The cache and TLB are still accessed in par allel so the upper 2 bits of the cache index must be virtual Hence up to four cache entries could be aliased to the same physical memory address As the L2 cache on the chip includes all entries in the L1 caches on a L1 miss it checks the other three possi ble cache locations in the L2 cache for aliases If it finds one it flushes it from the caches to prevent aliases from occurring A common compromise between these two design points is caches that are virtually indexed sometimes using just the page offset portion of the address which is really a physical address since it is untranslated but use physical tags These designs which are virtually indexed but physically tagged attempt to achieve the performance advan tages of virtually indexed caches with the architecturally simpler advantages of a physi physically addressed cache A cally addressed cache For example there is no alias problem in this case The L1 data cache that is addressed by a cache of the Pentium 4 is an example as would the lntrinsity if the page size was 4 KB physical address To pull off this trick there must be careful coordination between the minimum page size the cache size and associativity Elaboration The FastMATH TLB is a bit more complicated than in Figure 7 24 MIPS includes two physical page mappings per virtual page number thereby mapping an even odd pair of virtual page numbers into two physical page numbers Hence the tag is 1 bit narrower since each entry corresponds to two pages The least significant bit of the vir tual page number selects between the two physical pages There are separate book keeping bits for each physical page This optimization doubles the amount of memory mapped per TLB entry As the Elaboration on page 530 explains the tag field actually includes an B bit address space ID field to reduce the cost of context switches To sup port the variable page sizes mentioned on page 537 there is also a 32 bit mask field that determines the dividing line between the virtual page address and the page offset Implementing Protection with Virtual Memory One of the most important functions for virtual memory is to allow sharing of a single main memory by multiple processes while providing memory protection among these processes and the operating system The protection mechanism must,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science544.txt

Computer_Science,8 2 Disk Storage and Dependability 577 Unlike RAID 1 many disks must be read to determine the missing data The assumption behind this technique is that taking longer to recover from failure but spending less on redundant storage is a good trade off Block Interleaved Parity RAID 4 RAID 4 uses the same ratio of data disks and check disks as RAID 3 but they access data differently The parity is stored as blocks and associated with a set of data blocks In RAID 3 every access went to all disks However some applications prefer smaller accesses allowing independent accesses to occur in parallel That is the purpose of the RAID levels 4 to 6 Since error detection information in each sector is checked on reads to see if data are correct such small reads to each disk can occur independently as long as the minimum access is one sector In the RAID context a small access goes to just one disk in a protection group while a large access goes to all the disks in a protection group Writes are another matter It would seem that each small write would demand that all other disks be accessed to read the rest of the information needed to recalculate the new parity as in Figure 8 7 A small write would require reading the old data and old parity adding the new information and then writing the new parity to the parity disk and the new data to the data disk New Data 1 Read 2 Read 3 Read New Data 1 Read 2 Read DOJ XOR EJ 8 EJ 8 om DO AJJ AJJ 4 Write 5 Write 3 Write 4 Write FIGURE 8 7 Small write update on RAID 3 versus RAID 4 This optimization for smaU writes reduces the number ofdisk accesses as well as the number ofdisks occupied This figure assumes we have four blocks ofdata and one block of p 1rity The straightforward RAIO 3 parity calculation in the left of the figure reads blocks 01 02 and 03 before adding block DO to calculate the new parity P In case you were wondering the new data 00 comes directly from the CPU so disks are not involved in reading iL The RAIO 4 shortcut on the right reads the old value DO and comp 1fes it to the new value 00 to see which bits wiU change You then read to old p 1rity P and then change the corresponding bits to form P The logical function exclusive OR does exactly what we want This example replaces three disk reads 01 02 03 and two disk writes 00 P involving all the disks for tm disk reads DO P and two disk writes DO P which in olve just two disks Increasing the size of the parity group increases the wings of the shortcut RAIO 5 uses the Ille shortcut ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science593.txt

Computer_Science,8 2 Disk Storage and Dependability 575 with many small disks performance would improve because there would be more read heads and there would be advantages in cost power and floor space since smaller disks are much more efficient per gigabyte than larger disks Redundancy was needed because the many more smaller disks had lower reliability than a few large disks By having many small disks the cost of extra redundancy to improve depend ability is small relative to the large disks Thus dependability was more affordable if you constructed a redundant array of inexpensive disks In retrospect this was the key advantage How much redundancy do you need Do you need extra information to find the faults Does it matter how you organize the data and the extra check informa tion on these disks The paper that coined the term gave an evolutionary answer to these questions starting with the simplest but most expensive solution Figure 8 6 shows the evolution and example cost in number of extra check disks To keep track of the evolution the authors numbered the stages of RAID and they are still used today No Redundancy RAID 0 Simply spreading data over multiple disks called striping automatically forces striping Allocation oflogically accesses to several disks Striping across a set of disks makes the collection appea r sequential blocks to separate disks to allow higher perfor to software as a single large disk which simplifies storage management It also mance than a single disk can improves performance for large accesses since many disks can operate at once deliver Video editing systems for example often stripe their data and may not worry about dependability as much as say databases RAID 0 is something of a misnomer as there is no redundancy However RAID levels are often left to the operator to set when creating a storage system and RAID 0 is often listed as one of the options Hence the term RAID 0 has become widely used Mirroring RAID 1 This traditional scheme for tolerating disk failure called mirroring or shadowing mirroring Writing the identi o uses twice as many disks as does RAID Whenever data are written to one disk cal data to multiple disks to increase data availability those data are also written to a redundant disk so that there are always two copies of the information If a disk fails the system just goes to the mirror and reads its contents to get the desired information Mirroring is the most expensive RAID solution since it requires the most disks Error Detecting and Correcting Code RAID 2 RAID 2 borrows an error detection and correction scheme most often used for memories see Appendix B Since RAID 2 has fallen into disuse we ll not describe it here ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science591.txt

Computer_Science,530 Chapter 7 Large and Fast Exploiting Memory Hierarchy Remember that each process has its own virtual address space Thus if the operating system keeps the page tables organized so that the independent virtual pages map to disjoint physical pages one process will not be able to access another s data Of course this also requires that a user process be unable to change the page table mapping The operating system can assure safety if it prevents the user process from modifying its own page tables Yet the operating system must be able to modify the page tables Placing the page tables in the protected address space of the operating system satisfies both requirements Vhen processes want to share information in a limited way the operating sys tem must assist them since accessing the information of another process requires changing the page table of the accessing process The write access bit can be used to restrict the sha ring to just read sharing and like the rest of the page table this bit can be changed only by the operating system To allow another process say PI to read a page owned by process P2 P2 would ask the operating system to create a page table entry for a virtual page in PI s address space that points to the same physical page that P2 wants to share The operating system could use the write protection bit to prevent PI from writing the data if that was P2 s wish Any bits that determine the access rights for a page must be included in both the page table and the TLB because the page table is accessed only on a TLB miss Elaboration When the operating system decides to change from running process Pi wntext switch A changing of to running process P2 called a context switch or process switch it must ensure that P2 the internal state ofthe proces cannot get access to the page tables of Pi because that would compromise protection If sor to allow a different process there is no TLB it suffices to change the page table register to point to P2 s page table to use the processor that rather than to Pi s with a TLB we must clear the TLB entries that belong to Pi both to includes saving the state needed protect the data of Pi and to force the TLB to load the entries for P2 If the process to renlfll to the currently exe switch rate were high this could be quite inefficient For example P2 might load only a cuting process few TLB entries before the operating system switched back to Pi Unfortunately Pi would then find that all its TLB entries were gone and would have to pay TLB misses to reload them This problem arises because the virtual addresses used by Pi and P2 are the same and we must clear out the TLB to avoid confusing these addresses A common alternative is to extend the virtual address space by adding a process identifier or task identifier The lntrinsity FastMATH has an B bit address space ID ASID field for this purpose This small field identifies the currently running process it is kept in a register loaded by the operating system when it switches processes The process identifier is concatenated to the tag portion of the TLB so that a TLB hit occurs only if both the page number and the process identifier match This combination eliminates the need to clear the TLB except on rare occasions Similar problems can occur for a cache since on a process switch the cache will contain data from the running process These problems arise in different ways for phys ically addressed and virtually addressed caches and a variety of different solutions such as process identifiers are used to ensure that a process gets its own data ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science546.txt

Computer_Science,60 Chapter 2 Instructions Language of the Computer The MIPS offset plus base register addressing is an excellent match to structures as well as arrays since the register can point to the beginning of the structure and the off set can select the desired element We ll see such an example in Section 2 13 The register in the data transfer instructions was originally invented to hold an index of an array with the offset used for the starting address of an array Thus the base register is also called the index register loday s memories are much larger and the software model of data allocation is more sophisticated so the base address of the array is normally passed in a register since it won t fit in the offset as we shall see Section 2 4 explains that since MIPS supports negative constants there is no need for subtract immediate in MIPS Representing Instructions in the Computer We are now ready to explain the difference between the way humans instruct computers and the way computers see instructions First let s quickly review how a computer represents numbers Humans are taught to think in base 10 but numbers may be represented in any base For example 123 base 10 1111011base2 Numbers are kept in computer hardware as a series of high and low electronic signals and so they are considered base 2 numbers Just as base 10 numbers are called decimal numbers base 2 numbers are called binary numbers A single digit of a binary number is thus the atom of computing since all information is com binary digit Also called binary posed of binary digits or bits This fundamental building block can be one of two bit One ofthe two numbers in values which can be thought of as several alternatives high or low on or off true base 2 0 or 1 that are the com or false or I or O ponents ofinformation Instructions are also kept in the computer as a series of high and low electronic signals and may be represented as numbers In fact each piece of an instruction can be considered as an individual number and placing these numbers side by side forms the instruction Since registers are part of almost all instructions there must be a convention to map register names into numbers In MIPS assembly language registers 50 to 57 map onto registers 16 to 23 and registers tO to t7 map onto registers 8 to IS Hence 50 mea ns register 16 s 1 mea ns register 17 s 2 mea ns register 18 tO means register 8 t1 means register 9 and so on We ll describe the convention for the rest of the 32 registers in the following sections ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science76.txt

Computer_Science,2 13 A C Sort Example to Put It All Together 127 Calling swa p is easy enough jal swap Passing Parameters in so r t The problem comes when we want to pass parameters because the sort proce dure needs the values in registers aO and a1 yet the swap procedure needs to have its parameters placed in those same registers One solution is to copy the parameters for sor t into other registers earlier in the procedure making registers aO and a1 available for the call of swap This copy is faster than saving and restoring on the stack We first copy a0 and a 1 into s 2 and s 3 during the procedure move s2 aO copy parameter aO into s2 move s3 a1 copy parameter a1 into s3 Then we pass the parameters to swap with these two instructions move aO s2 first swap parameter is v move a1 sl second swap parameter is j Preserving Registers in so r t The only remaining code is the saving and restoring of registers Clearly we must save the return address in register ra since sor t is a procedure and is called itself The sort procedure also uses the saved registers sO sl s2 and s3 so they must be saved The prologue of the sort procedure is then addi sp sp 20 make room on stack for 5 regs sw ra 16 sp save ra on stack SW s3 12 sp save s3 on stack SW s2 8 sp save s2 on stack SW sl 4 sp save sl on stack sw sO O sp save sO on stack The tail of the procedure simply reverses all these instructions then adds a j r to return The Full Procedure sort Now we put all the pieces together in Figure 2 36 being careful to replace refer ences to registers aO and a1 in the for loops with references to registers s 2 and s3 Once again to make the code easier to follow we identify each block of code with its purpose in the procedure In this example 9 lines of the sort procedure in C became 35 lines in the MIPS assembly language ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science143.txt

Computer_Science,5 5 A Multleyele Implementation 325 Breaking the Instruction Execution into Clock Cycles Given the datapath in Figure 5 28 we now need to look at what should happen in each clock cycle of the multicycle execution since this will determine what addi tional control signals may be needed as well as the setting of the control signals Our goal in breaking the execution into clock cycles should be to maximize performance We can begin by breaking the execution of any instruction into a series of steps each taking one clock cycle attempting to keep the amount of work per cycle roughly equal For example we will restrict each step to contain at most one ALU operation or one register file access or one memory access With this restriction the clock cycle could be as short as the longest of these operations Recall that at the end of every clock cycle any data values that will be needed on a subsequent cycle must be stored into a register which can be either one of the major state elements e g the PC the register file or the mem ory a temporary register written on every clock cycle e g A B MDR or ALUOut or a tempo rary register with write control e g lR Also remember that because our design is edge triggered we can continue to read the current value of a register the new value does not appear until the next clock cycle In the single cycle datapath each instruction uses a set of datapath elements to carry out its execution Many of the datapath elements operate in series using the output of another element as an input Some datapath elements operate in paral lel for example the PC is incremented and the instruction is read at the same time A similar situation exists in the multicycle datapath All the operations listed in one step occur in parallel within 1 clock cycle while successive steps operate in series in different clock cycles The limitation of one ALU operation one memory access and one register file access determines what can fit in one step Notice that we distinguish between reading from or writing into the PC o r one of the stand alone registers and reading from o r writing into the register file In the former case the read or write is part of a clock cycle while reading or writing a result into the register file takes an additional clock cycle The reason for this dis tinction is that the register file has additional control and access overhead com pared to the single stand alone registers Thus keeping the clock cycle short motivates dedicating separate clock cycles for register file accesses The potential execution steps and their actions are given below Each MIPS instruction needs from three to five of these steps 1 Instruction fetch step Fetch the instruction from memo ry and compute the address of the next sequen tial instruction IR Memory PC PC PC 4 ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science341.txt

Computer_Science,380 Chapter 6 Enhancing Performance with Plpellnlng The equivalent decision task in a computer is the branch instruction Notice that we must begin fetching the instruction following the branch on the very next clock cycle But the pipeline cannot possibly know what the next instruction should be since it only just received the branch instruction from memory Just as with laundry one possible solution is to stall immediately after we fetch a branch waiting until the pipeline determines the outcome of the branch and knows what instruction address to fetch from Let s assume that we put in enough extra hardware so that we can test registers calculate the branch address and update the PC during the second stage of the pipeline see Section 6 6 for details Even with this extra hardware the pipeline involving conditional branches would look like Figure 6 7 The 1w instruction executed if the branch fails is stalled one extra 200 ps clock cycle before starting Performance of Stall on Branch Estimate the impact on the clock cycles per instruction CPI of stalling on EXAMPLE branches Assume all other instructions have a CPl of I Figure 3 26 on page 228 in Chapter 3 shows that branches are 13 of the in ANSWER structions executed in SPECint2000 Since other instructions run have a CPI of 1 and branches took one extra clock cycle for the stall then we would see a CPI of 1 1 3 and hence a slowdown of 1 1 3 versus the ideal case Notice that this includes only branches and that jumps might also incur a stall Program 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 execution Time order in instructions lns1roct Data 0 add 4 5 6 0 lelch InslNC1 Oala 0 beq 1 2 40 0 felch 200 ps _ I I 8 or 7 8 9 400 ps folch ALU FIGURE 6 7 Pipeline showing stalling on every conditional branch as solution to control hazards There is a one stage pipeline stall or bubble after the branch In reality the process of creating a stall is slightly more complicated as we will see in Section 6 6 The effect on performance however is the same as would occur if a bubble were inserted ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science396.txt

Computer_Science,7 4 Virtual Memory 531 Handling TLB Misses and Page Faults Although the tra tlslation of virtual to physical addresses with a TLB is straightfor ward when we get a TLB hit handling TLB misses and page faults are more com plex A TLB miss occurs when no entry in the TLB matches a virtual address A TLB miss can indicate one of two possibilities I The page is present in memory and we need only create the missing TLB entry 2 The page is not present in memory and we need to transfer control to the operating system to deal with a page fault How do we know which of these two circumstances has occurred Vhen we pro cess the TLB miss we will look for a page table entry to bring into the TLB If the matching page table entry has a valid bit that is turned off then the corresponding page is not in memory and we have a page fault rather than just a TLB miss If the valid bit is on we can simply retrieve the desired entry A TLB miss can be handled in softwa re or hardwa re because it will require only a short sequence of operations to copy a valid page table entry from memory into the TLB MIPS traditioll3lly handles a TLB miss in software It brings in the page table entry from memory and then reexecutes the instruction that caused the TLB miss Upon reexecuting it will get a TLB hit If the page table entry indicates the page is not in memory this time it will get a page fault exception Handling a TLB miss or a page fault requires using the exception mechanism to interrupt the active process transferring control to the operating system and later resuming execution of the interrupted process A page fault will be recognized sometime during the clock cycle used to access memory To restart the instruction after the page fault is handled the program counter of the instruction that caused the page fault must be saved Just as in Chapters 5 and 6 the exception program counter EPC is used to hold this value In addition a TLB miss or page fault exception must be asserted by the end of the same clock cycle that the memory access occurs so that the next clock cycle will begin exception processing rather than continue normal instruction execu tion If the page fault was not recognized in this clock cycle a load instruction could overwrite a register and this could be disastrous when we try to restart the instruction For example consider the instruction 1w 1 0 1 the computer must be able to prevent the write pipeline stage from occurring otherwise it could not properly restart the instruction since the contents of 1 would have been destroyed A similar complication arises on stores Ve must prevent the write into memory from actually completing when there is a page fault this is usually done by deasserting the write control line to the memory ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science547.txt
Computer_Science,7 4 Virtual Memory 537 operating system can change the address translations which is implemented by preventing user programs from changing the page tables Controlled sharing of pages among processes can be implemented with the help of the operating sys tem and access bits in the page table that indicate whether the user program has read or write access to a page If a processor had to access a page table resident in memory to translate every access virtual memory would have too much overhead and caches would be pointless Instead a TLB acts as a cache for translations from the page table Addresses are then translated from virtual to physical using the translations in the TLB Caches virtual memory and TLBs all rely on a common set of principles and policies The next section discusses this common framework Although virtual memory was invented to enable a small memory to act as a Understanding large one the performance difference between disk and memory means that if Program a program routinely accesses more virtual memory than it has physical mem Performance ory it will run very slowly Such a program would be continuously swapping pages between memory and disk called thrashing Thrashing is a disaster if it occurs but it is rare If your program thrashes the easiest solution is to run it on a computer with more memory or buy more memory for your computer A more complex choice is to reexamine your algorithm and data structures to see if you can change the locality and thereby reduce the number of pages that your program uses simultaneously This set of pages is informally called the working set A more common performance problem is TLB misses Since a TLB might han dle only 32 64 page entries at a time a program could easily see a high TLB miss rate as the processor may access less than a quarter megabyte directly 64 X 4 KB 0 25 MB For example TLB misses are often a challenge for Radix Sort To try to alleviate this problem most computer architectures now support variable page sizes For example in addition to the standard 4 KB page MIPS hardware sup ports 16 KB 64 KB 256 KB 1 MB 4 MB 16 MB 64 MB and 256 MB pages Hence if a program uses large page sizes it can access more memory directly without TLB misses The practical challenge is getting the operating system to allow programs to select these larger page sizes Once again the more complex solution to reducing TLB misses is to reexamine the algorithm and data structures to reduce the work ing set of pages ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science553.txt

Computer_Science,188 Chapter 3 Arithmetic for Computers The reason the answer isn t a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 1 which would also fit this formula is that the absolute value of the quotient would then change depending on the sign of the dividend and the divisorl Clearly if x y t x y programming would be an even greater challenge This anomalous behavior is avoided by following the rule that the dividend and remainder must have the same signs no matter what the signs of the divisor and quotient We calculate the other combinations by following the same rule 7 2 Quotient 3 Remainder 1 7 2 Quotient 3 Remainder 1 Thus the correctly signed division algorithm negates the quotient if the signs of the operands are opposite and makes the sign of the nonzero remainder match the dividend Faster Division We used 32 adders to speed up multiply but we cannot do the same trick for divide The reason is that we need to know the sign of the difference before we can perform the next step of the algorithm whereas with multiply we could calculate the 32 partial products immediately There are techniques to produce more than one bit of the quotient per bit The SRT division technique tries to guess several quotient bits per step using a table lookup based on the upper bits of the dividend and remainder It relies on subse quent steps to correct wrong guesses A typical value today is 4 bits The key is guessing the value to subtract With binary division there is only a single choice These algorithms use 6 bits from the remainder and 4 bits from divisor to index a table that determines the guess for each step The accuracy of this fast method depends on having proper values in the lookup table The fallacy on page 222 in Section 3 8 shows what can happen if the table is incorrect Divide in MIPS You may have already observed that the same sequential hardware can be used for both multiply and divide in Figures 3 7 and 3 13 The only requirement is a 64 bit register that can shift left or right and a 32 bit ALU that adds or subtracts Hence MIPS uses the 32 bit Hi and 32 bit 1 0 registers for both multiply and divide As we might expect from the algorithm above Hi contains the remainder and Lo contains the quotient after the divide instruction completes To handle both signed integers and unsigned integers MIPS has two instructions divide di v and divide l nsigned di vu The MIPS assembler allows divide instructions to specify three registers generating the mfl or mfh i 0 instructions to place the desired result into a general purpose register ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science204.txt

Computer_Science,348 Chapter 5 The Processor Datapath and Control would need to be extended to handle the demands of the more complex instructions without reusing components which would be completely impractical For example a single cycle datapath which doesn t reuse com ponents for the IA 32 would require several data memories and a very microprogrammed ontrol A large number of ALUs method ofspecifying control Using the multicycle datapath and a microprogrammed controller pro that uses microcode rather than vides a framework for implementing the IA 32 instruction set The challeng a finite state representation ing task however is creating a high performance implementation which hardwired control An imple requires dea ling with the diversity of the requirements arising from different mentation offinite state instructions Simply put a high performance implementation needs to ensure machine control typically using that the simple instructions execute quickly and that the burden of the com programmable logic arrays plexities of the instruction set penalize primarily the complex less frequently PIAs or collections ofPLAs used instructions and random logic To accomplish this goal every Intel implementation of the IA 32 architecture since the 486 has used a combination of hardwired control to handle simple microcode The set of micro instructions and microcoded control to handle the more complex instructions For instructions that control a those instructions that can be executed in a single pass through the datapath those processor with complexity similar to a MIPSinstmction the hardwired control generates the control information and executes the instmction in one pass through the datapath that takes a small number of clock cycles Those instructions that require multiple datapath passes and complex sequencing are handled by the microcoded controller that takes a larger number of cycles and multiple passes throUgil the datapath to complete the execution of the instmction The benefit of this approach is that it enables the designer to achieve low cycle counts for the simple instmctions without having to build the enormously complex datapath that would be required to handle the full generality of the most complex instmctions The Structure of the Pentium 4 Implementation superscalar An advanced pipe Recent Pentium processors are capable of executing more than one instruction lining technique that enables the per clock using an advanced pipelining technique called superscalar We processor to execute more than describe how a superscalar processor works in the next chapter The important one instruction per dock cycle thing to understand here is that executing more than one instruction per clock mkroinstruction A represen requires duplicating the datapath resources The simplest way to think about this tation of control using low level is that the processor has multiple datapaths although these are tailored to handle instructions each ofwhich one class of instmctions say loads and stores ALU operations or branches In asserts a set of control sign als this way the processor is able to execute a load or store in the same clock cycle that that are active on a given dock it is also executing a branch and an ALU operation The Pentium III and 4 allow cycle as well as specifies what up to three IA 32 instmctions to execute in a clock cycle microinstruction to execute next The Pentium III and Pentium 4 execute simple microinstructions similar to RIse micro operations The MIPS instructions called micro operations in Intel terminology These microin like instructions directly exe structions are fully self contained operations that are initially about 70 bits wide cuted by the hardware in recent Pentium implementations The control of datapath to implement these microinstmctions is completely hard ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science364.txt

Computer_Science,386 Chapter 6 Enhancing Performance with Plpellnlng There are however two exceptions to this left to right flow of instructions The write back stage which places the result back into the register file in the middle of the datapath The selection of the next value of the PC choosing between the incremented PC and the branch address from the MEM stage Data flowing from right to left does not affect the current instruction only later instructions in the pipeline are influenced by these reverse data movements Note that the first right to left arrow can lead to data hazards and the second leads to control hazards One way to show what happens in pipelined execution is to pretend that each instruction has its own datapath and then to place these datapaths on a time line to show their relationship Figure 6 1 0 shows the execution of the instructions in Figure 6 3 by displaying their private datapaths on a common time line We use a stylized version of the datapath in Figure 6 9 to show the relationships in Figure 6 10 Figure 6 10 seems to suggest that three instructions need three datapaths In Chapter 5 we added registers to hold data so that portions of the datapath could be shared during instruction execution we use the same technique here to share the multiple datapaths For example as Figure 6 10 shows the instruction mem ory is used during only one of the five stages of an instruction allowing it to be shared by other instructions during the other four stages To retain the value of an individual instruction for its other four stages the value read from instruction memory must be saved in a register Similar argu ments apply to every pipeline stage so we must place registers wherever there are dividing lines between stages in Figure 6 9 This change is similar to the registers added in Chapter 5 when we went from a single cycle to a multicycle datapath Returning to our laundry analogy we might have a basket between each pair of stages to hold the clothes for the next step Figure 6 11 shows the pipelined datapath with the pipeline registers high lighted All instructions adva nce during each clock cycle from one pipeline regis ter to the next The registers are named for the two stages separated by that register For example the pipeline register between the IF and ID stages is called IFIID Notice that there is no pipeline register at the end of the write back stage All instructions must update some state in the processor the register file memory or the PC so a separate pipeline register is redundant to the state that is updated For example a load instruction will place its result in 1 of the 32 registers and any later instruction that needs that data will simply read the appropriate register Of course every instruction updates the PC whether by incrementing it or by setting it to a branch destination address The PC can be thought of as a pipeline register one that feeds the IF stage of the pipeline Unlike the shaded pipeline reg ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science402.txt

Computer_Science,3 6 Floating Point 191 Just as we can show decimal numbers in scientific notation we can also show binary numbers in scientific notation 1 I Otwoxr To keep a binary number in normalized form we need a base that we can increase or decrease by exactly the number of bits the number must be shifted to have one nonzero digit to the left of the decimal point Only a base of 2 fulfills our need Since the base is not 10 we also need a new name for decimal point binary point will do fine Computer arithmetic that supports such numbers is called floating point floating point Computer because it represents numbers in which the binary point is not fixed as it is for arithmetic that represents num bers in which the binary point is integers The programming language C uses the namefloat for such numbers Just not fIxed as in scientific notation numbers are represented as a single nonzero digit to the left of the binary point In binary the form is YYYY l xxxxxxxxx WOX 2 Although the computer represents the exponent in base 2 as well as the rest of the number to simplify the notation we show the exponent in decimal A standard scientific notation for reaIs in normalized form offers three advan tages It simplifies exchange of data that includes floating point numbers it sim plifies the floating point arithmetic algorithms to know that numbers will always be in this form and it increases the accuracy of the numbers that can be stored in a word since the unnecessary leading Os are replaced by real digits to the right of the binary point Roating Point Representation A designer of a floating point representation must find a compromise between the size of the fraction and the size of the exponent because a fixed word size fraction The value generally means you must take a bit from one to add a bit to the other This trade off is between 0 and 1 placed in the fraction fIeld between precision and range Increasing the size of the fraction enhances the pre cision of the fraction while increasing the size of the exponent increases the range exponent In the numerical of numbers that can be represented As our design guideline from Chapter 2 representation system of float ing point arithmetic the value reminds us good design demands good compromise that is placed in the exponent Floating point numbers are usually a multiple of the size of a word The repre field sentation of a MIPS floating point number is shown below where s is the sign of the floating point number I meaning negative exponent is the value of the 8 bit exponent field including the sign of the exponent and fraction is the 23 bit number This representation is called sign and magnitude since the sign has a sep arate bit from the rest of the number ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science207.txt

Computer_Science,3 6 Floating Point 197 Elaboration In an attempt to increase range without removing bits from the signifi cand some computers before the IEEE 754 standard used a base other than 2 For example the IBM 360 and 370 mainframe computers use base 16 Since changing the IBM exponent by one means shifting the significand by 4 bits normalized base 16 numbers can have up to 3 leading bits of Os Hence hexadecimal digits mean that up to 3 bits must be dropped from the significand which leads to surprising problems in the accuracy of floating point arithmetic as noted in Section Roating Point Addition Let s add numbers in scientific notation by hand to illustrate the problem s in 1 floating point addition 9 999 X WI 1 61O X 10 Assume that we can store ten ten only four decimal digits of the significand and two decimal digits of the exponent Step 1 To be able to add these numbers properly we must align the decimal point of the number that has the smaller exponent Hence we need a fo rm 1 of the smaller number 1 6lO X 10 that matches the larger exponent ten We obtain this by observing that there are multiple representations of an unnormalized floating point number in scientific notation 1 1 6 1O X 10 0 1 61O X 10 0 0 16 10 X WI ten ten ten The number on the right is the version we desire since its exponent matches the exponent of the larger number 9 999 X WI Thus the first ten step shifts the significand of the smaller number to the right until its cor rected exponent matches that of the larger number But we can represent only four decimal digits so after shifting the number is really I 0 0 16 X 10 ten Step 2 Next comes the addition of the significands 9 999 ten 0 0 16 ten 1O 0 15 ten The sum is 10 0 15 X WI ten Step 3 This sum is not in normalized scientific notation so we need to adjust it I 2 10 0 15 X 10 1 00 15 X 10 ten ten Thus after the addition we may have to shift the sum to put it into nor malized fo rm adjusting the exponent appropriately This example shows,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science213.txt

Computer_Science,382 Chapter 6 Enhancing Performance with Plpellnlng branch prediction A method A more sophisticated version of branch prediction would have some branches ofresolving a branch hazard predicted as taken and some as untaken In our analogy the dark or home uni that assumes a given outcome forms might take one formula while the light or road uniforms might take for the branch and proceeds another As a computer example at the bottom of loops are branches that jump from that assumption rather back to the top of the loop Since they are likely to be taken and they branch back than waiting to ascertain the wards we could always predict taken for branches that jump to an earlier address actual outcome Such rigid approaches to branch prediction rely on stereotypical behavior and don t account for the individuality of a specific branch instruction Dynamic hard ware predictors in stark contrast make their guesses depending on the behavior of each branch and may change predictions for a branch over the life of a pro gram Following our analogy in dynamic prediction a person would look at how dirty the uniform was and guess at the formula adjusting the next guess depend ing on the success of recent guesses One popular approach to dynamic prediction of branches is keeping a history for each branch as taken or untaken and then using the recent past behavior to predict the future As we will see later the amount and type of history kept have become extensive with the result being that dynamic branch predictors can correctly predict branches with over 90 accuracy see Section 6 6 hen the guess is wrong the pipeline control must ensure that the instructions following the wrongly guessed branch have no effect and must restart the pipeline from the proper branch address In our laundry analogy we must stop taking new loads so that we can restart the load that we incorrectly pre dicted As in the case of all other solutions to control hazards longer pipelines exacer bate the problem in this case by raising the cost of misprediction Solutions to control hazards are described in more detail in Section 6 6 Elaboration There is a third approach to the control hazard called delayed decision In our analogy whenever you are going to make such a decision about laundry just place a load of nonfootball clothes in the washer while waiting for football uniforms to dry As long as you have enough dirty clothes that are not affected by the test this solu tion works fine Called the delayed branch in computers this is the solution actually used by the MIPS architecture The delayed branch always executes the next sequential instruction with the branch taking place after that one instruction delay It is hidden from the MIPS assembly language programmer because the assembler can automatically arrange the instructions to get the branch behavior desired by the programmer MIPS software will place an instruction immediately after the delayed branch instruction that is not affected by the branch and a taken branch changes the address of the instruction that follows this safe instruction In our example the add instruction before the branch in Figure 6 7 does not affect the branch and can be moved after the branch to fully hide the branch delay Since delayed branches are useful when the branches are short no processor uses a delayed branch of more than 1 cycle For longer branch delays hard ware based branch prediction is usually used ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science398.txt

Computer_Science,6 1 An Overview of Plpellnlng 383 Pipeline Overview Summary Pipelining is a technique that exploits parallelism among the instructions in a sequential instruction stream It has the substantial advantage that unlike some speedup techniques see Chapter 9 it is fundamentally invisible to the pro grammer In the next sections of this chapter we cover the concept of pipelining using the MIPS instruction subset 1 add sub and or sl t and beq same as Chap W SW ter 5 and a simplified version of its pipeline We then look at the problems that pipelining introduces and the performance attainable under typical situations If you wish to focus more on the software and the performance implications of pipelining you now have sufficient background to skip to Section 6 9 Section 6 9 introduces advanced pipelining concepts such as superscalar and dynamic sched uling and Section 6 10 examines the pipeline of the Pentium 4 microprocessor Alternatively if you are interested in understanding how pipelining is imple mented and the challenges of dealing with hazards you can proceed to examine the design of a pipelined datapath explained in Section 6 2 and the basic control explained in Section 6 3 You can then use this understanding to explore the implementation of forwarding in Section 6 4 and the implementation of stalls in Section 6 5 You can then read Section 6 6 to learn more about solutions to branch hazards and then see how exceptions are handled in Section 6 8 BIG Pipelining increases the number of simultaneously executing instructions The and the rate at which instructions are started and completed Pipelining Picture does not reduce the time it takes to complete an individual instruction also called the latency For example the five stage pipeline still takes 5 clock cycles for the instruction to complete In the terms used in Chapter 4 pipelining improves instruction throughput rather than individual latency pipeline The num instruction execution time or latency ber ofstages in a pipeline or the number ofstages between two Instruction sets can either simplify or make life harder for pipeline instructions during execution designers who must already cope with structural control and data haz ards Branch prediction forwarding and stalls help make a computer fast while still getting the right answers ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science399.txt

Computer_Science,542 Chapter 7 Large and Fast Exploiting Memory Hierarchy so expensive and relatively infrequent approximating this information primarily in software is acceptable Question 4 What Happens on a Write A key characteristic of any memory hierarchy is how it deals with writes We have already seen the two basic options Write through The information is written to both the block in the cache and to the block in the lower level of the memory hierarchy main memory for a cache The caches in Section 7 2 used this scheme Write back also called copy back The information is written only to the block in the cache The modified block is written to the lower level of the hierarchy only when it is replaced Virtual memory systems always use write back for the reasons discussed in Section 7 4 Both write back and write through have their advantages The key advantages of write back are the following Individual words can be written by the processor at the rate that the cache rather than the memory can accept them Multiple writes within a block require only one write to the lower level in the hierarchy When blocks are written back the system can make effective use of a high bandwidth transfer since the entire block is written Write through has these advantages Misses are simpler and cheaper because they never require a block to be written back to the lower level Write through is easier to implement than write back although to be prac tical in a high speed system a write through cache will need to use a write buffer In virtual memory systems only a write back policy is practical because of the long latency of a write to the lower level of the hierarchy disk As processors con tinue to increase in performance at a faster rate than DRAM based main memory the rate at which writes are generated by a processor will exceed the rate at which the memory system can process them even allowing for physically and logically wider memories Consequently more and m ore caches are using a write back strategy ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science558.txt

Computer_Science,422 Chapter 6 Enhancing Performance with Plpellnlng The steady state prediction behavior will mispredict on the first and last loop ANSWER iterations Mispredicting the last iteration is inevitable since the prediction bit will say taken the branch has been taken nine times in a row at that point The misprediction on the first iteration happens because the bit is flipped on prior execution of the last iteration of the loop since the branch was not tak en on that exiting iteration Thus the prediction accuracy for this branch that is taken 90 of the time is only 80 two incorrect predictions and eight correct ones Ideally the accuracy of the predictor would match the taken branch frequency for these highly regular branches To remedy this weakness 2 bit prediction schemes are often used In a 2 bit scheme a prediction must be wrong twice before it is changed Figure 6 39 shows the finite state machine for a 2 bit predic tion scheme A branch prediction buffer can be implemented as a small special buffer accessed with the instruction address during the IF pipe stage If the instruction is predicted as taken fetching begins from the target as soon as the PC is known as mentioned on page 418 it can be as early as the 10 stage Otherwise sequential Taken Not taken Prwdict taken Taken 1 Not taken T keo Not taken Taken FIGURE 6 39 The states In a 2 b1t prediction scheme By using 2 bits rather than l a branch that strongly favors taken or not taken as many branches do will be mispredicted only once The 2 bits are U ied to encode the four states in the system The two bit scheme is a general instance of a counter based predictor which is incremented when the prediction is accurate and decremented otherwise and U ies the midpoint of its range as the division between taken and not taken ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science438.txt

Computer_Science,346 Chapter 5 The Processor Datapath and Control Elaboration If you examine the finite state machine in Figure 5 40 closely you can see that some problems could occur in the way the exceptions are handled For exam pie in the case of arithmetic overflow the instruction causing the overflow completes writing its result because the overflow branch is in the state when the write completes However it s possible that the architecture defines the instruction as having no effect if the instruction causes an exception this is what the MIPS instruction set architecture specifies In Chapter 7 we will see that certain classes of exceptions require us to pre vent the instruction from changing the machine state and that this aspect of handling exceptions becomes complex and potentially limits performance Check Is this optimization proposed in the Check Yourself on page 340 concerning PCSource still valid in the extended control for exceptions shown in Figure 5 40 Yourself on page 345 Why or why not Microprogramming Simplifying Control Design Microprogramming is a technique for designing complex control units It uses a very simple hardware engine that can then be programmed to implement a more complex instruction set Microprogramming is used today to implement some parts of a complex instruction set such as a Pentium as well as in special purpose processors This section which appears on the CD explains the basic concepts and shows how they can be used to implement the MIPS multicycle control An Introduction to Digital Design Using a Hardware Design Language Modern digital design is done using hardware description languages and modern computer aided synthesis tools that can create detailed hardware designs from the descriptions using both libraries and logic synthesis Entire books are written on such languages and their use in digital design This section which appears on the CD gives a brief introduction and shows how a hardware design language Verilog in this case can be used to describe the MIPS multicycle control both behaviorally and in a form suitable for hardware synthesis ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science362.txt

Computer_Science,596 Chapter 8 One method to allow the system to initiate DMA transfers that cross page boundaries is to make the DMA work on virtual addresses In such a system the DMA unit has a small number of map entries that provide virtual to physical mapping for a transfer The operating system provides the mapping when the I O is initiated By using this mapping the DMA unit need not worry about the loca tion of the virtual pages involved in the transfer Another technique is for the operating system to break the DMA transfer into a series of transfers each confined within a single physical page The transfers are then chained together and handed to an I O processor or intelligent DMA unit that executes the entire sequence of transfers alternatively the operating system can individually request the transfers Whichever method is used the operating system must still cooperate by not remapping pages while a DMA transfer involving that page is in progress We have looked at three different methods for transferring data between an I O device and memory In moving from polling to an interrupt driven to a DMA interface we shift the burden for managing an I O operation from the processor to a progressively more intelligent I O controller These methods have the advan tage of freeing up processor cycles Their disadva ntage is that they increase the cost of the I O system Because of this a given computer system can choose which point along this spectrum is appropriate for the I O devices connected to it Before discussing the design of I O systems let s look briefly at performance measures of them Hardware The coherency problem for I O data is avoided by using one of three major tech niques One approach is to route the I O activity through the cache This ensures Software that reads see the latest value while writes update any data in the cache Routing all Interface I O through the cache is expensive and potentially has a large negative perfor mance impact on the processor since the I O data is rarely used immediately and may displace useful data that a running program needs A second choice is to have the OS selectively invalidate the cache for an I O read or force write backs to occur for an I O write often called cachej1ushillg This approach requires some small amount of hardwa re support and is probably more efficient if the softwa re can perform the function easily and efficiently Because this flushing of large parts of the cache need only happen on DMA block accesses it will be relatively infre quent The third approach is to provide a hardware mechanism for selectively flushing or invalidating cache entries Hardware invalidation to ensure cache coherence is typical in multiprocessor systems and the same technique can be used for I O we discuss this topic in detail in Chapter 9 ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science612.txt
Computer_Science,59 Chapter 8 Actually performing a read or write of data to fulfill a program request usually requires several separate I O operations Furthermore the processor may have to interrogate the status of the device between individual commands to determine whether the command completed successfully For example a simple printer has two I O device registers one for status information and one for data to be printed The Status register contains a done bit set by the printer when it has printed a character and an error bit indicating that the printer is jammed or out of paper Each byte of data to be printed is put into the Data register The proces sor must then wait until the printer sets the done bit before it can place another character in the buffer The processor must also check the error bit to determine if a problem has occurred Each of these operations requires a separate I O device access ItO instru tions A dedicated Elaboration The alternative to memory mapped I O is to use dedicated I O instruc instruction that is lIsed to give a tions in the processor These I O instructions can specify both the device number and va command to an device and the command word or the location of the command word in memory The processor that specifies both the device communicates the device address via a set of wires normally included as part of the number and the command I O bus The actual command can be transmitted over the data lines in the bus Exam word or the location ofthe ples of computers with I O instructions are the IntellA 32 and the IBM 370 computers command word in memory By making the I O instructions illegal to execute when not in kernel or supervisor mode user programs can be prevented from accessing the devices directly Communicating with the Processor The process of periodically checking status bits to see if it is time for the next I O polling The process ofperiodi operation as in the previous example is called polling Polling is the simplest way cally checking the status ofan for an I O device to communicate with the processor The I O device simply puts I O device to determine the the information in a Status register and the processor must come and get the need to sen ice the device information The processor is totally in control and does all the work Polling can be used in several different ways Real time embedded applications poll the I O devices since the I O rates are predetermined and it makes I O over head more predictable which is helpful for real time As we will see this allows polling to be used even when the I O rate is somewhat higher The disadvantage of polling is that it can waste a lot of processor time because processors are so much faster than I O devices The processor may read the Status register many times only to find that the device has not yet completed a compara tively slow I O operation or that the mouse has not budged since the last time it was polled Vhen the device completes an operation we must still read the status to determine whether it was successful interrupt driven ItO An I O scheme that employs interrupts The overhead in a polling interface was recognized long ago leading to the to indicate to the processor that invention of interrupts to notify the processor when an I O device requires atten an I O device needs attention tion from the processor Interrupt driven I O which is used by almost all systems,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science606.txt

Computer_Science,8 5 Interfacing I O Devices to the Processor Memory and Operating System 591 for at least some devices employs I O interrupts to indicate to the processor that an I O device needs attention When a device wants to notify the processor that it has completed some operation or needs attention it causes the processor to be interrupted An I O interrupt is just like the exceptions we saw in Chapters 5 6 and 7 with two important exceptions I An I O interrupt is asynchronous with respect to the instruction execution That is the interrupt is not associated with any instruction and does not prevent the instruction completion This is very different from either page fault exceptions or exceptions such as arithmetic overflow Our control unit need only check for a pending I O interrupt at the time it starts a new instruction 2 In addition to the fact that an I O interrupt has occurred we would like to convey further information such as the identity of the device generating the interrupt Furthermore the interrupts represent devices that may have dif ferent priorities and whose interrupt requests have different urgencies asso ciated with them To communicate information to the processor such as the identity of the device raising the interrupt a system can use either vectored interrupts or an exception Cause register When the processor recognizes the interrupt the device can send either the vector address or a status field to place in the Cause register As a result when the OS gets control it knows the identity of the device that caused the interrupt and can immediately interrogate the device An interrupt mecha nism eliminates the need for the processor to poll the device and instead allows the processor to focus on executing programs Interrupt Priority Levels To deal with the different priorities of the I O devices most interrupt mechanisms have several levels of priority UNIX operating systems use four to six levels These priorities indicate the order in which the processor should process interrupts Both internally generated exceptions and external I O interrupts have priorities typically I O interrupts have lower priority than internal exceptions There may be multiple I O interrupt priorities with high speed devices associated with the higher priorities To support priority levels for interrupts MIPS provides the primitives that let the operating system implement the policy similar to how MIPS handles TLB misses Figure 8 1 3 shows the key registers and Section A 7 in Appendix A gives more details The Status register determines who can interrupt the computer If the interrupt enable bit is 0 then none can interrupt A more refined blocking of interrupts is available in the interrupt mask field There is a bit in the mask corresponding to,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science607.txt

Computer_Science,5 9 Real Stuff The Organization of Recent Pentium Implementations 347 Real Stuff The Organization of Recent Pentium Implementations The techniques described in this chapter for building datapaths and control units are at the heart of every computer All recent computers however go beyond the techniques of this chapter and use pipelining Pipelilling which is the subject of the next chapter improves performance by overlapping the execution of multiple instructions achieving throughput close to one instruction per clock cycle like our single cycle implementation with a clock cycle time determined by the delay of individual functional units rather than the entire execution path of an instruc tion like our multicycle design The last Intel lA 32 processor without pipelining was the 80386 introduced in 1985 the very first MIPS processor the R2000 also introd uced in 1985 was pipelined Recent Intel IA 32 processors the Pentium II III and 4 employ sophisticated pipelining approaches These processors however are still faced with the chal lenge of implementing control for the complex IA 32 instruction set described in Chapter 2 The basic functional units and datapaths in use in modern processors while significantly more complex than those described in this chapter have the same basic functionality and similar types of control signals Thus the task of designing a control unit builds on the same principles used in this chapter Challenges Implementing More Complex Architectures Unlike the MIPS architecture the IA 32 architecture contains instructions that are very complex and can take tens if not hundreds of cycles to execute For example the string move instruction MOVS requires calculating and updating two different memory addresses as well as loading and storing a byte of the string The larger number and greater complexity of addressing modes in the IA 32 architecnlfe complicates implementation of even simple instructions similar to those on MIPS Fortunately a multicycle datapath is well structured to adapt to variations in the amount of work required per instruction that are inherent in IA 32 instructions This adaptability comes from two capabilities 1 A multicycle datapath allows instructions to take varying numbers of clock cycles Simple IA 32 instructions that are similar to those in the MIPS architecture ca n execute in 3 or 4 clock cycles while more complex instruc tions can take tens of cycles 2 A multicycle datapath ca n use the datapath components more than once per instruction This is critical to handling more complex addressing modes as well as implementing more complex operations both of which are present in the IA 32 architecture Without this capability the datapath,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science363.txt

Computer_Science,7 10 Exercises 555 restructuring the loops that access the arrays substantially improved locality and therefore cache performance can be obtained The example on page 551 showed how effective even a simple change of loop structure could be Another direction is to try to use compiler directed prefetching In prefetch prefetching A technique in ing a block of data is brought into the cache before it is actually referenced The which data blocks needed in the fi lture are brought into the compiler tries to identify data blocks needed in the funlfe and using special cache early by the use ofspecial instructions tells the memory hierarchy to move the blocks into the cache When instructions that specify the the block is actually referenced it is found in the cache rather than causing a address ofthe block cache miss The use of secondary caches has made prefetching even more attrac tive since the secondary cache can be involved in a prefetch while the primary cache continues to service processor requests As we will see in Chapter 9 memory systems are also a central design issue for parallel processors The growing importance of the memory hierarchy in determining system performance in both uniprocessor and multiprocessor sys tems means that this important area will continue to be a focus of both designers and researchers for some years to come Historical Perspective and Further Reading This history section gives an overview of memory technologies from mercury delay lines to DRAM the invention of the memory hierarchy and protection mechanisms and concludes with a brief history of operating systems including crss MULTICS UNIX BSD UNIX MS DOS Windows and Linux Exercises 7 1 5 7 1 SRAM is commonly used to implement small fa st on chip caches while DRAM is used for larger slower main memory In the past a common de sign for supercomputers was to build machines with no caches and main memo ries made entirely out of SRAM the Cray C90 for example a very fa st computer in its day If cost were no object would you still want to design a system this way 7 2 O 7 2 Describe the general characteristics of a program that would ex hibit very little temporal and spatial locality with regard to data accesses Provide an example program pseudocode is fine ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science571.txt
Computer_Science,7 6 Real Stuff The Pentium P4 and the AMD Opteron Memory Hierarchies 549 the RAM cells in a multiported memory must be much larger than single ported cells The alternative scheme is to break the cache into banks and allow multiple independent accesses provided the accesses are to different banks The technique is similar to interleaved main memory see Figure 7 11 on page 489 To reduce the memory traffic in a multiprocessor configuration Intel has other versions of the P4 with much larger on dlip caches in 2004 For example the Intel Pentium P4 Xeon comes with third level cache chip of 1 MB and is intended for 011 dual processor servers A more radical example is the Intel Pentium P4 Extreme Edition which comes with 2 MB of L3 cache but no support for multiprocessing These two chips are much larger and more expensive For example in 2004 a Preci sion Workstation 360 with a 3 2 GHz P4 costs about 1900 Upgrading to the Extreme Edition processor adds 500 to the price The Dell Precision Workstation 450 which allows dual processors costs about 2000 for a 3 2 GHz Xeon with 1MB of L3 cache Adding a second processor like that one adds 1500 to the price The sophisticated memory hierarchies of these chips and the large fraction of the dies dedicated to caches and TLBs show the significant design effort expended to try to close the gap between processor cycle times and memory latency Future advances in processor pipeline designs together with the increased use of multi processing that presents its own problems in memory hierarchies provide many new challenges for designers Elaboration Perhaps the largest difference between the AMD and Intel chips is the use of a trace cache for the P4 instruction cache while the AMD Opteron uses a more traditional instruction cache Instead of organizing the instructions in a cache block sequentially to promote spa tial locality a trace cache finds a dynamic sequence of instructions including taken branches to load into a cache block Thus the cache blocks contain dynamic traces of the executed instructions as determined by the CPU rather than static sequences of instructions as determined by memory layout It folds branch prediction Chapter 6 into the cache so the branches must be validated along with the addresses in order to have a valid fetch In addition the P4 caches the micro operations see Chapter 5 rather than the IA 32 instructions as in the Opteron Clearly trace caches have much more complicated address mapping mechanisms since the addresses are no longer aligned to power of two multiples of the word size Trace caches can improve utilization of cache blocks however For example very long blocks in conventional caches may be entered from a taken branch and hence the first portion of the block occupies space in the cache that might not be fetched Simi larly such blocks may be exited by taken branches so the last portion of the block might be wasted Given that taken branches or jumps occur every 5 10 instructions effective block utilization is a real problem for processors like the Opteron whose 64 byte block would likely include 16 24 80x86 instructions Trace caches store instruc tions only from the branch entry point to the exit of the trace thereby avoiding such,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science565.txt

Computer_Science,8 5 Interfacing I O Devices to the Processor Memory and Operating System 589 The OS handles the interrupts generated by I O devices just as it handles the exceptions generated by a progra tn The OS tries to provide equitable access to the shared I O resources as well as schedule accesses in order to enhance system throughput To perform these functions on behalf of user programs the operating system must be able to communicate with the I O devices and to prevent the user pro gram from communicating with the I O devices directly Three types of commu nication are required I The OS must be able to give commands to the I O devices These com mands include not only operations like read and write but also other oper ations to be done on the device such as a disk seek 2 The device must be able to notify the OS when the I O device has com pleted an operation or has encountered an error For example when a disk os completes a seek it will notify the 3 Data must be transferred between memory and an I O device For example the block being read on a disk read must be moved from disk to memory In the next few sections we will see how these communications are performed Giving Commands to I O Devices To give a command to an I O device the processor must be able to address the device and to supply one or more command words Two methods are used to address the device memory mapped I O and special I O instructions In memory mapped I O An I O scheme in which portions of memory mapped 110 portions of the address space are assigned to I O devices address space are assigned to Reads and writes to those addresses are interpreted as commands to the I O I O devices and reads and writes device to those addresses are inter For example a write operation can be used to send data to an I O device where preted as commands to the I O the data will be interpreted as a command When the processor places the address device and data on the memory bus the memory system ignores the operation because the address indicates a portion of the memory space used for I O The device con troller however sees the operation records the data and transmits it to the device as a command User programs are prevented from issuing I O operations directly os because the does not provide access to the address space assigned to the I O devices and thus the addresses are protected by the address translation Memory mapped I O can also be used to transmit data by writing or reading to select addresses The device uses the address to determine the type of command and the data may be provided by a write or obtained by a read In any event the address encodes both the device identity and the type of transmission between processor and device ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science605.txt
Computer_Science,8 5 Interfacing I O Devices to the Processor Memory and Operating System 595 sors as well as I O controllers or channel controllers These specialized processors basically execute a series of I O operations called an I O program The program may be stored in the I O processor or it may be stored in memory and fetched by the I O processor When using an I O processor the operating system typically sets up an I O program that indicates the I O operations to be done as well as the size and transfer address for any reads or writes The I O processor then takes the operations from the I O program and interrupts the processor only when the entire program is completed DMA processors are essentially special purpose processors usually single chip and nonprogrammable while I O processors are often implemented with general purpose microprocessors which run a specialized I O program Direct Memory Access and the Memory System When OMA is incorporated into an I O system the relationship between the memory system and processor changes Without OMA all accesses to the memory system come from the processor and thus proceed through address translation and cache access as if the processor generated the references With DMA there is another path to the memory system one that does not go through the address translation mechanism or the cache hierarchy This difference generates some problems in both virtual memory systems and systems with caches These prob lems are usually solved with a combination of hardware techniques and software support The difficulties in having DMA in a virtual memory system arise because pages have both a physical and a virtual address DMA also creates problems for systems with caches because there can be two copies of a data item one in the cache and one in memory Because the DMA processor issues memory requests directly to the memory rather than through the processor cache the value of a memory loca tion seen by the OMA unit and the processor may differ Consider a read from disk that the OMA unit places directly into memory If some of the locations into which the DMA writes are in the cache the processor will receive the old value when it does a read Similarly if the cache is write back the DMA may read a value directly from memory when a newer value is in the cache and the value has not been written back This is called the stale data problem or coherence problem In a system with virtual memory should DMA work with virtual addresses or Hardware physical addresses The obvious problem with virtual addresses is that the DMA Software unit will need to translate the virtual addresses to physical addresses The major Interface problem with the use of a physical address in a DMA transfer is that the transfer cannot easily cross a page boundary If an I O request crossed a page boundary then the memory locations to which it was being transferred would not necessar ily be contiguous in the virtual memory Consequently if we use physical addresses we must constrain all DMA transfers to stay within one page ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science611.txt

Computer_Science,594 Chapter 8 hundreds to thousands of bytes Thus computer designers invented a mecha nism for offioading the processor and having the device controller transfer data directly to or from the memory without involving the processor This mechanism direct memory access DMA is called direct memory access OMA The interrupt mechanism is still used by A mechanism that provides a the device to communicate with the processor but only on completion of the I O device controller the ability to transfer or when an error occurs transfer data directly to or from DMA is implemented with a specialized controller that transfers data between the memory without involving an I O device and memory independent of the processor The DMA controller the processor becomes the bus master and directs the reads or writes between itself and mem bus master A unit on the bus ory There are three steps in a DMA transfer that can initiate bus requests I The processor sets up the DMA by supplying the identity of the device the operation to perform on the device the memory address that is the source or destill3tion of the data to be transferred and the number of bytes to transfer 2 The DMA starts the operation on the device and arbitrates for the bus When the data is available from the device or memory it transfers the data The DMA device supplies the memory address for the read or the write If the request requires more than one transfer on the bus the DMA unit generates the next memory address and initiates the next transfer Using this mechanism a DMA unit can complete an entire transfer which may be thousands of bytes in length without bothering the processor Many DMA controllers contain some memory to allow them to deal flexi bly with delays either in transfer or those incurred while waiting to become bus master 3 Once the DMA transfer is complete the controller interrupts the processor which can then determine by interrogating the DMA device or examining memory whether the entire operation completed successfully There may be multiple DMA devices in a computer system For example in a system with a single processor memory bus and multiple I O buses each I O bus controller will often contain a DMA processor that handles any transfers between a device on the I O bus and the memory Unlike either polling or interrupt driven I O DMA can be used to interface a hard disk without consuming all the processor cycles for a single I O Of course if the processor is also contending for memory it will be delayed when the memory is busy doing a DMA transfer By using caches the processor can avoid having to access memory most of the time thereby leaving most of the memory bandwidth free for use by I O devices Elaboration To further reduce the need to interrupt the processor and occupy it in handling an I O request that may involve doing several actual operations the I O con troller can be made more intelligent Intelligent controllers are often called I O proces ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science610.txt

Computer_Science,7 2 The Basics of Caches 485 In a write back cache because we cannot overwrite the block stores either require two cycles a cycle to check for a hit follo Ned by a cycle to actually perform the write or require an extra buffer called a store buffer to hold that data effectively allowing the store to take only one cycle by pipelining it When a store buffer is used the processor does the cache lookup and places the data in the store buffer during the normal cache access cycle Assuming a cache hit the new data is written from the store buffer into the cache on the next unused cache access cycle By comparison in a write through cache writes can always be done in one cycle There are some extra complications with multiword blocks however since we cannot simply overwrite the tag when we write the data Instead we read the tag and write the data portion of the selected block If the tag matches the address of the block being written the processor can continue normally since the correct block has been updated If the tag does not match the processor generates a write miss to fetch the rest of the block corresponding to that address Because it is always safe to overwrite the data write hits still take one cycle Many write back caches also include write buffers that are used to reduce the miss penalty when a miss replaces a dirty block In such a case the dirty block is moved to a write back buffer associated with the cache while the requested block is read from memory The write back buffer is later written back to memory Assuming another miss does not occur immediately this technique halves the miss penalty when a dirty block must be replaced An Example Cache The Intrinsity FastMATH processor The Intrinsity FastMATH is a fast embedded microprocessor that uses the MIPS architecture and a simple cache implementation Near the end of the chapter we will examine the more complex cache design of the Intel Pentium 4 but we start with this simple yet real example for pedagogical reasons Figure 7 9 shows the orga nization of the Intrinsity FastMATH data cache This processor has 12 stage pipeline similar to that discussed in Chapter 6 When operating at peak speed the processor can request both an instruction word and a data word on every clock To satisfy the demands of the pipeline with out stalling separate instruction and data caches are used Each cache is 16 KB or 4K words with 16 word blocks Read requests for the cache are straightforward Because there are separate data and instruction caches separate control signals will be needed to read and write each cache Remember that we need to update the instruction cache when a miss occurs Thus the steps for a read request to either cache are as follows I Send the address to the appropriate cache The address comes either from the PC for an instruction or from the ALU for data 2 If the cache signals hit the requested word is available on the data lines Since there are 16 words in the desired block we need to select the right,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science501.txt

Computer_Science,290 Chapter 5 The Processor Datapath and Control when the data value is written The output from a state element provides the value that was written in an earlier clock cycle For example one of the logically sim plest state elements is a D type flip flop see Appendix B which has exactly these two inputs 3 value and a clock and one output In addition to flip flops our MIPS implementation also uses two other types of state elements memories and registers both of which appear in Figure 5 1 The clock is used to determine when the state element should be written a state element can be read at any time Logic components that contain state are also called sequential because their outputs depend on both their inputs and the contents of the internal state For example the output from the functional unit representing the registers depends both on the register numbers supplied and on what was written into the registers previously The operation of both the combinational and sequential elements and II their construction are discussed in more detail in Appendix B We will use the word asserted to indicate a signal that is logically high and assert to specify that a signal should be driven logically high and deassert or deasserted to represent logical low Clocking Methodology docking methodology The A docking methodology defines when signals can be read and when they can be approach used to determine written It is important to specify the timing of reads and writes because if a sig when data is valid and stable rel nal is written at the same time it is read the value of the read could correspond to ative to the clock the old value the newly written value o r even some mix of the two Needless to say computer designs cannot tolerate such unpredictability A clocking methodol ogy is designed to prevent this circumstance edge triggered docking A For simplicity we will assume an edge triggered clocking methodology An clocking scheme in which all edge triggered clocking methodology means that any values stored in a sequential state changes occur on a clock logic element are updated only on a clock edge Because only state elements can edge store a data value any collection of combinational logic must have its inputs com ing from a set of state elements and its outputs written into a set of state elements The inputs are values that were written in a previous clock cycle while the outputs are values that can be used in a following clock cycle Figure 5 3 shows the two state elements surrounding a block of combinational logic which operates in a single clock cycle All signals must propagate from state element 1 through the combinational logic and to state element 2 in the time of one clock cycle The time necessary for the signals to reach state element 2 defines wlltrol signal A signal used the length of the clock cycle for multiplexor selection or for For simplicity we do not show a write control signal when a state element is directing the operation ofa written on every active clock edge In contrast if a state element is not updated on functional unit contrasts with a every clock then an explicit write control signal is required Both the clock signal data signal which contains and the write control signal are inputs and the state element is changed only information that is operated on when the write control signal is asserted and a clock edge occurs by a functional unit ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science306.txt

Computer_Science,484 Chapter 7 Large and Fast Exploiting Memory Hierarchy memory can complete writes is less than the rate at which the processor is gener ating writes no amount of buffering can help because writes are being generated faster than the memory system can accept them The rate at which writes are generated may also be less than the rate at which the memory can accept them and yet stalls may still occur This can happen when the writes occur in bursts To reduce the occurrence of such stalls processors usu ally increase the depth of the write buffer beyond a single entry write back A scheme that han The alternative to a write through scheme is a scheme called write back In a dles writes by updating values write back scheme when a write occurs the new value is written only to the block only to the block in the cache in the cache The modified block is written to the lower level of the hierarchy then writing the modified block when it is replaced Write back schemes can improve performance especially to the lower level ofthe hierar when processors can generate writes as fast or faster than the writes can be han chy when the block is replaced dled by main memory a write back scheme is however more complex to imple ment than write through In the rest of this section we describe caches from real processors and we examine how they handle both reads and writes In Section 7 5 we will describe the handling of writes in more detail Elaboration Writes introduce several complications into caches that are not present for reads Here we discuss two of them the policy on write misses and efficient imple mentation of writes in write back caches Consider a miss in a write through cache The strategy followed in most write through cache designs called fetch n miss fetch m write or sometimes aliocate Jn miss allocates a cache block to the address that missed and fetches the rest of the block into the cache before writing the data and continuing execution Alternatively we could either allocate the block in the cache but not fetch the data called no fetch n write or even not allocate the block called no aliocate Jn write Another name for these strategies that do not place the written data into the cache is write around since the data is written around the cache to get to memory The motivation for these schemes is the observation that sometimes programs write entire blocks of data before reading them In such cases the fetch associated with the initial write miss may be unnecessary There are a number of subtle issues involved in implementing these schemes in multiword blocks including complicating the handling of write hits by requir ing mechanisms similar to those used for write back caches Actually implementing stores efficiently in a cache that uses a write back strategy is more complex than in a write through cache In a write back cache we must write the block back to memory if the data in the cache is dirty and we have a cache miss If we simply overwrote the block on a store instruction before we knew whether the store had hit in the cache as we could for a write through cache we would destroy the contents of the block which is not backed up in memory A write through cache can write the data into the cache and read the tag if the tag mismatches then a miss occurs Because the cache is write through the overwriting of the block in the cache is not cat astrophic since memory has the correct value ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science500.txt

Computer_Science,446 Chapter 6 Enhancing Performance with Plpellnlng Hardware Given that compilers can also schedule code around data dependences you might ask Why would a superscalar processor use dynamic scheduling There are three Software major reasons First not all stalls are predictable In particular cache misses see Interface Chapter 7 cause unpredictable stalls Dynamic scheduling allows the processor to hide some of those stalls by continuing to execute instructions while waiting for the stall to end Second if the processor speculates on branch outcomes using dynamic branch prediction it cannot know the exact order of instructions at compile time since it depends on the predicted and actual behavior of branches Incorporating dynam ic speculation to exploit more lLP without incorporating dynamic sched uling would significantly restrict the benefits of such speculation Third as the pipeline latency and issue width change from one implementation to another the best way to compile a code sequence also changes For example how to schedule a sequence of dependent instructions is affected by both issue width and latency The pipeline structure affects both the number of times a loop must be unrolled to avoid stalls as well as the process of compiler based register renam ing Dynamic scheduling allows the hardware to hide most of these details Thus users and software distributors do not need to worry about having multiple ver sions of a program for different implementations of the same instruction set Sim ilarly old legacy code will get much of the benefit of a new implementation without the need for recompilation BIG Both pipelining and multiple issue execution increase peak instruction The throughput and attempt to exploit ILP Data and control dependences in Picture programs however offer an upper limit on sustained performance because the processor must sometimes wait for a dependence to be resolved Software centric approaches to exploiting ILP rely on the ability of the compiler to find and reduce the effects of such dependences while hardware centric approaches rely on extensions to the pipeline and issue mechanisms Speculation performed by the compiler or the hardware can increase the amount of ILP that can be exploited although care must be taken since speculating incorrectly is likely to reduce performance ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science462.txt

Computer_Science,96 Chapter 2 Instructions Language of the Computer Hardware Either the compiler or the assembler must break large constants into pieces and then reassemble them into a register As you might expect the immediate field s size restric Software tion may be a problem for memory addresses in loads and stores as well as for constants Interface in immediate instmctions If this job falls to the assembler as it does for MIPS software then the assembler must have a temporary register available in which to create the long values l1lis is a reason for the register at which is reserved for the assembler Hence the symbolic representation of the MIPS machine language is no longer limited by the hardware but to whatever the creator of an assembler chooses to include see Section 2 10 We stick close to the hardware to explain the architec ture of the computer noting when we use the enhanced language of the assembler that is not found in the processor Loading a 32 8it Constant EXAMPLE What is the MIPSassembly code to load this 32 bit constant into register sO 0000 0000 0011 1101 0000 1001 0000 0000 ANSWER First we would load the upper 16 bits which is 61 in decimal using 1ui lui sO 61 61 decimal 0000 0000 0011 1101 binary The value of register sO afterward is 0000 0000 0011 1101 0000 0000 0000 0000 The next step is to add the lower 16 bits whose decimal value is 2304 ori sO sO 2304 2304 decimal 0000 1001 0000 0000 The fin al value in register sO is the desired value 0000 0000 0011 1101 0000 1001 0000 0000 Elaboration Creating 32 bit constants needs care The instruction addi copies the leftmost bit of the 16 bit immediate field of the instruction into the upper 16 bits of a word Logical or immediate from Section 2 5 loads Os into the upper 16 bits and hence is used by the assembler in conjunction with 1ui to create 32 bit constants ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science112.txt

Computer_Science,2 9 MIPS Addressing for 32 111t Immedlates and Addresses 97 Addressing in Branches and Jumps The MIPS jump instructions have the simplest addressing They use the final MIPS instruction format called the I type which consists of 6 bits for the opera tion field and the rest of the bits for the address field Thus 10000 go t o loc at ion 10000 J could be assembled into this format it s actually a bit more complicated as we will see on the next page ____ 1 0 0 0 _ 6 bits 26 bits where the value of the jump opcode is 2 and the jump address is 10000 Unlike the jump instruction the conditional branch instruction must specify two operands in addition to the branch address Thus bne sO sl Exi t go t o Exit if sO sl is assembled into this instruction leaving only 16 bits for the branch address 5 6 17 Exit 6 bits 5 bits 5 bits 16 bits If addresses of the program had to fit in this 16 bit field it would mea n that no 16 program could be bigger than 2 which is far too small to be a realistic option today An alternative would be to specify a register that would always be added to the branch address so that a branch instruction would calculate the following Program counter Register Branch address 32 This sum allows the program to be as large as 2 and still be able to use condi tional branches solving the branch address size problem The question is then which register The answer comes from seeing how conditional branches are used Conditional branches are found in loops and in if statements so they tend to branch to a nearby instruction For example about half of all conditional branches in SPEC2000 benchmarks go to locations less than 16 instructions away Since the program counter PC contains the address of the current instruction we can,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science113.txt

Computer_Science,4 3 Evaluating Performance 255 Unfortunately the code produced for one of the benchmarks was wrong a fact that was discovered when a competitor read through the binary to understand how Intel had sped up one of the programs in the benchmark suite so dramati cally In January 1996 Intel admitted the error and restated the performance Small programs or programs that spend almost all their execution time in a very small code fragment are especially vulnerable to such efforts So why doesn t everyone run real programs to measure performance One rea son is that small benchmarks are attractive when beginning a design since they are small enough to compile and simulate easily sometimes by hand They are especially tempting when designers are working on a novel computer because compilers may not be available until much later in the design Although the use of such small benchmarks early in the design process may be justified there is no valid rationale for using them to evaluate working computer systems As mentioned earlier different classes and applications of computers will require different types of benchmarks For desktop computers the most common bench marks are either measures of CPU performance or benchmarks focusing on a spe cific task such as DVD playback or graphics performance for games In Section 4 4 we will examine the SPEC CPU benchmarks which focus on CPU performance and measure response time to complete a benchmark For servers the decision of which benchmark to use depends heavily on the nature of the intended application For scientific servers CPU oriented benchmarks with scientific applications are typi cally used and response time to complete a benchmark is the metric For other server environments benchmarks of Web serving file serving and databases are commonly used These server benchmarks usually emphasize throughput albeit with possible requirements on response time to individual events such as a database query or Web page request Section 4 4 examines the SPECweb99 benchmark designed to test Web server performance In embedded computing good bench marks are much more rare Often customers use their specific embedded applica tion or a segment of it for benchmarking purposes The one major benchmark suite developed for embedded computers is EEMBC and we discuss those benchmarks in the In More Depth section on the CD Once we have selected a set of suitable benchmarks and obtained performance measurements we can write a performance report The guiding principle in reporting performance measurements should be reproducibility we should list everything another experimenter would need to duplicate the results This list must include the version of the operating system compilers and the input as well as the computer configuration As an example the system description section of a SPEC CPU2000 benchmark report is in Figure 4 3 One important element of reproducibility is the choice of input Different inputs ca n generate quite different behavior For example an input can trigger certain execution paths that may be typical or it may exercise rarely used and,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science271.txt

Computer_Science,7 2 The Basics of Caches 491 300 MHz The two key advantages of SDRAMs are the use of a clock that eliminates the need to synchronize and the elimination of the need to supply successive addresses in the burst The DDR part of the name means data transfers on both the leading and falling edge of the clock thereby getting twice as much bandwidth as you might expect based on the clock rate and the data width To deliver such high band width the internal DRAM is organized as interleaved memory banks The advantage of these optimizations is that they use the circuitry already largely on the DRAMs adding little cost to the system while achieving a significant improvement in bandwidth The internal architecture of DRAMs and how these optimizations are II implemented are described in Section 8 8 of Appendix 8 Summary We began the previous section by examining the simplest of caches a direct mapped cadle with a one word block In such a cadle both hits and misses are simple since a word can go in exactly one location and there is a separate tag for every word To keep the cache and memory consistent a write through scheme can be used so that every write into the cache also causes memory to be updated The alternative to write through is a write back scheme that copies a block back to memory when it is replaced we ll discuss this scheme further in upcoming sections To take advantage of spatial locality a cache must have a block size larger than one word The use of a larger block decreases the miss rate and improves the effi ciency of the cache by reducing the amount of tag storage relative to the amount of data storage in the cache Although a larger block size decreases the miss rate it can also increase the miss penalty If the miss penalty increased linearly with the block size larger blocks could easily lead to lower perform ance To avoid this the bandwidth of main memory is increased to transfer cache blocks more efficiently The two common methods fo r doing this are making the memory wider and interleaving In both cases we reduce the time to fetch the block by minimizing the number of times we must start a new memo ry access to fetch a block and with a wider bus we can also decrease the time needed to send the block from the memo ry to the cache The speed of the memo ry system affects the designer s decision on the size of the Check cache block Vhich of the following cache designer guidelines are generally valid Yourself 1 The shorter the memory latency the smaller the cache block 2 The shorter the memory latency the larger the cache block 3 The higher the memory bandwidth the smaller the cache block 4 The higher the memory bandwidth the larger the cache block ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science507.txt

Computer_Science,482 Chapter 7 Large and Fast Exploiting Memory Hierarchy access where it works best Instruction accesses are largely sequential so if the memo ory system can deliver a word every clock cycle the processor may be able to restart operation when the requested word is returned with the memory system delivering new instruction words just in time This technique is usually less effective for data caches because it is likely that the words will be requested from the block in a less predictable way and the probability that the processor will need another word from a different cache block before the transfer completes is high If the processor cannot access the data cache because a transfer is ongoing then it must stall An even more sophisticated scheme is to organize the memory so that the requested word is transferred from the memory to the cache first The remainder of the block is then transferred starting with the address after the requested word and wrap ping around to the beginning of the block This technique called requested word first or critical word first can be slightly faster than early restart but it is limited by the same properties that limit early restart Handling Cache Misses Before we look at the cache of a real system let s see how the control unit deals ache miss A request for data with cache misses The control unit must detect a miss and process the miss by from the cache that cannot be fetching the requested data from memory or as we shall see a lower level cache filled because the data is not If the cache reports a hit the computer continues using the data as if nothing had present in the cache happened Consequently we can use the same basic control that we developed in Chapter 5 and enhanced to accommodate pipelining in Chapter 6 The memories in the datapath in Chapters 5 and 6 are simply replaced by caches Modifying the control of a processor to handle a hit is trivial misses however require some extra work The cache miss handling is done with the processor con trol unit and with a separate controller that initiates the memory access and refills the cadle The processing of a cache miss creates a stall similar to the pipeline stalls discussed in Chapter 6 as opposed to an interrupt which would require saving the state of all registers For a cache miss we can stall the entire processor essentially freezing the contents of the temporary and programmer visible registers while we wait for memory In contrast pipeline stalls discussed in Chapter 6 are more com plex because we must continue executing some instructions while we stall others Let s look a little more closely at how instruction misses are handled for either the multicycle or pipelined datapath the same approach can be easily extended to handle data misses If an instruction access results in a miss then the content of the Instruction register is invalid To get the proper instruction into the cache we must be able to instruct the lower level in the memory hierarchy to perform a read Since the program counter is incremented in the first clock cycle of execu tion in both the pipelined and multicycle processors the address of the instruc tion that generates an instruction cache miss is equal to the value of the program counter minus 4 Once we have the address we need to instruct the main memory,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science498.txt

Computer_Science,284 Chapter 5 The Processor Datapath and Control Introduction In Chapter 4 we saw that the performance of 1 machine was determined by three key factors instruction count clock cycle time and clock cycles per instruction CPl The compiler and the instruction set architecture which we examined in Chapters 2 and 3 determine the instruction count required for a given program However both the clock cycle time and the number of clock cycles per instruction are determined by the implementation of the processor In this chapter we con struct the datapath and control unit for two different implementations of the MIPS instruction set This chapter contains an explanation of the principles and techniques used in implementing a processor starting with a highly abstract and simplified overview in this section followed by sections that build up a datapath and construct a sim ple version of a processor sufficient to implement instructions sets like MIPS and finally developing the concepts necessary to implement more complex instruc tions sets like the IA 32 For the reader interested in understanding the high level interpretation of instructions and its impact on program performance this initial section provides enough background to understand these concepts as well as the basic concepts of pipelining which are expla ined in Section 6 1 of the next chapter For those readers desiring an understanding of how hardware implements instructions Sections 5 3 and 5 4 are all the additional material that is needed Furthermore these two sections are sufficient to understand all the material in Chapter 6 on pipelining Only those readers with an interest in hardware design should go further The remaining sections of this chapter cover how modern hardwa re includ ing more complex processors such as the Intel Pentium series is usually imple mented The basic principles of finite state control are explained and different methods of implementation including microprogramming are examined For the reader interested in understanding the processor and its performance in more depth Sections 5 4 and 5 5 will be useful For readers with an interest in modern hardware design Section 5 7 covers microprogramming a technique used to implement more complex control such as that present in IA 32 processors and Section 5 8 describes how hardwa re design languages and CAD tools are used to implement hardware ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science300.txt
Computer_Science,298 Chapter 5 The Processor Datapath and Control Creating a Single Datapath Now that we have examined the datapath components needed for the individual instruction classes we can combine them into a single datapath and add the con trol to complete the implementation The simplest datapath might attempt to exe cute all instructions in one clock cycle This means that no datapath resource can be used more than once per instruction so any element needed more than once must be duplicated We therefore need a memory for instructions separate from one for data Although some of the functional units will need to be duplicated many of the elements can be shared by different instruction flows To share a datapath element between two different instruction classes we may need to allow multiple connections to the input of an element using a multi plexor and control signal to select among the multiple inputs Building a Datapath The operations of arithmetic logical or R type instructions and the memory EXAMPLE instructions datapath are quite similar The key differences are the following The arithmetic logical instructions use the ALU with the inputs coming from the two registers The memory instructions ca n also use the ALU to do the address calculation although the second input is the sign ex tended 16 bit offset field from the instruction The value stored into a destination register comes from the ALU for an R type instruction or the memory for a load Show how to build a datapath for the operational portion of the memory ref erence and arithmetic logical instructions that uses a single register file and a single ALU to handle both types of instructions adding any necessary multi plexors ANSWER To create a datapath with only a single register file and a single ALU we must support two different sources for the second ALU input as well as two differ ent sources for the data stored into the register file Thus one multiplexor is placed at the ALU input and another at the data input to the register file Figure 5 10 shows the operational portion of the combined datapath Now we ca n combine all the pieces to make a simple datapath for the MIPS architecture by adding the datapath for instruction fetch Figure 5 6 on page 293 ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science314.txt

Computer_Science,7 2 The Basics of Caches 483 to perform a read We wait for the memory to respond since the access will take multiple cycles and then write the words into the cache We can now define the steps to be taken on an instruction cache miss I Send the original PC value current PC 4 to the memory 2 Instruct main memory to perform a read and wait for the memory to com plete its access 3 Write the cache entry putting the data from memory in the data portion of the entry writing the upper bits of the address from the ALU into the tag field and turning the valid bit on 4 Restart the instruction execution at the first step which will refetch the instruction this time finding it in the cache The control of the cache on a data access is essentially identical on a miSS we simply stall the processor until the memory responds with the data Handling Writes Writes work somewhat differently Suppose on a store instruction we wrote the data into only the data cache without changing main memory then after the write into the cache memory would have a different value from that in the cache In such a case the cache and memory are said to be inconsistent The simplest way to keep the main memory and the cache consistent is to always write the data into both the memory and the cache This scheme is called write through write through A scheme in The other key aspect of writes is what occurs on a write miss We first fetch the which writes always update both the cache and the memory words of the block from memory After the block is fetched and placed into the ensuring that data is always con cache we can overwrite the word that caused the miss into the cache block Ve sistent between the two also write the word to main memory using the full address Although this design handles writes very simply it would not provide very good performance With a write through scheme every write causes the data to be written to main memory These writes will take a long time likely at least 100 processor clock cycles and could slow down the processor considerably For the SPEC2000 integer benchmarks for example 10 of the instructions are stores If the CPI without caclle misses was 1 0 spending 100 extra cycles on every write would lead to a CPI of 1 0 100 x 10 II reducing performance by more than a factor of 10 One solution to this problem is to use a write buffer A write buffer stores the write buffer A queue that holds data while it is waiting to be written to memory After writing the data into the data while the data arewaiting to be written to memory cache and into the write buffer the processor can continue execution When a write to main memory completes the entry in the write buffer is freed If the write buffer is full when the processor reaches a write the processor must stall until there is an empty position in the write buffer Of course if the rate at which the,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science499.txt
Computer_Science,496 Chapter 7 Large and Fast Exploiting Memory Hierarchy As these examples illustrate relative cache penalties increase as a processor becomes faster Furthermore if a processor improves both clock rate and CPI it suffers a double hit I The lower the CPI the more pronounced the impact of stall cycles 2 The main memory system is unlikely to improve as fast as processor cycle time primarily because the performance of the underlying DRAM is not getting much faster When calculating CPI the cache miss penalty is mea sured in processor clock cycles needed for a miss Therefore if the main memories of two processors have the same absolute access times a higher processor clock rate leads to a larger miss penalty Thus the importance of cache performance for processors with low CPI and high clock rates is greater and consequently the danger of neglecting cache behavior in assessing the performance of such processors is greater As we will see in Section 7 6 the use of fast pipelined processors in desktop PCs and workstations has led to the use of sophisticated cache systems even in comput ers selling for less than a 1000 The previous examples and equations assume that the hit time is not a fac tor in determining cache performance Clea rly if the hit time increases the total time to access a word from the memory system will increase possibly causing an increase in the processor cycle time Although we will see addi tional examples of what can increase hit time shortly one example is increas ing the cache size A larger cache could clea rly have a longer access time just as if your desk in the library was very large say 3 square meters it would take longer to locate a book on the desk With pipelines deeper than five stages an increase in hit time likely adds another stage to the pipeline since it may take multiple cycles for a cache hit Although it is more complex to calcu late the performance impact of a deeper pipeline at some point the increase in hit time for a larger cache could dominate the improvement in hit rate lea d ing to a decrease in processor performance The next subsection discusses alternative cache organizations that decrease miss rate but may sometimes increase hit time additional examples appear in Fal lacies and Pitfalls Section 7 7 Reducing Cache Misses by More Rexible Placement of Blocks So far when we place a block in the cache we have used a simple placement scheme A block can go in exactly one place in the cache As mentioned earlier it,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science512.txt
Computer_Science,258 Chapter 4 Assessing and Understanding Performance where Time is the execution time for the ith program of a total of n in the work load Since it is the mean of execution times a smaller mean indicates a smaller average execution time and thus improved performance The arithmetic mean is proportional to execution time assuming that the pro grams in the workload are each run an equal number of times Is that the right workload If not we can assign a weighting factor wi to each program to indicate the frequency of the program in that workload If for example 20 of the tasks in the workload were program 1 and 80 of the tasks in the workload were program weighted arithmetic mean 2 then the weighting factors would be 0 2 and 0 8 By summing the products of An average of the execution weighting factors and execution times we can obtain a clear picture of the perfor time of a workload with weight mance of the workload This sum is called the weighted arithmetic mean One ing factors designed to reflect method of weighting programs is to choose weights so that the execution time of the presence of the programs in a workload computed as the each benchmark is equal on the computer used as the base The standard arith sum of the products of weight metic mean is a special case of the weighted arithmetic mean where all weights are ing factors and execution times equal We explore the weighted mea n in more detail in Exercises 4 1 5 and 4 1 6 Check 1 Suppose you are choosing between four different desktop computers one is Yourself an Apple Macintosh and the other three are PC compatible computers that use a Pentium 4 an AMD processor using the same compiler as the Pen tium 4 and a Pentium 5 which does not yet exist in 2004 but has the same architecture as the Pentium 4 and uses the same compiler Vhich of the following statements are true a The fastest computer will be the one with the highest clock rate b Since all PCs use the same Intel compatible instruction set and execute the sa me number of instructions for a program the fastest PC will be the one with the highest clock rate c Since AMD uses different techniques than Intel to execute instructions they may have different CPIs But you can still tell which of the two Pentium based PCs is fastest by looking at the clock rate d Only by looking at the results of benchmarks for tasks similar to your workload can you get an accurate picture of likely performance 2 Assume the following measurements of execution time were taken I Computer A Computer B ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science274.txt
Computer_Science,244 Chapter 4 Assessing and Understanding Performance In the above example we could also say that computer B is 1 5 times slower thall computer A since Performance A 1 5 Performance B means that Performance A Performance B 1 5 For simplicity we will normally use the terminology faster than when we try to compare computers quantitatively Because performance and execution time are reciprocals increasing performance requires decreasing execution time To avoid the potential confusion between the terms increasing and decreasing we usually say improve performance or improve execution time when we mean increase performance and decrease execution time Elaboration Performance in embedded systems is often characterized by real time constraints that is certain application specific events must occur within a limited amount of time There are two common types of real time constraints hard real time and soft real time Hard real time defines a fixed bound on the time to respond to or process some event For example the embedded processor that controls an antilock brake system must respond within a hard limit from the time it receives a signal that the wheels are locked In soft real time systems an average response or a response within a limited time to a large fraction of the events suffices For example handling video frames in a DVD playback system would be an example of a soft real time con straint since dropping a frame is permissible if it happens very rarely In embedded real time applications once the response time performance constraint is met design ers often optimize throughput or try to reduce cost Measuring Performance Time is the measure of computer performance the computer that performs the same amount of work in the least time is the fastest Program execlltion time is measured in seconds per program But time can be defined in different ways depending on what we count The most straightforward definition of time is called wall clock time response time or elapsed time These terms mean the total time to complete a task including disk accesses memory accesses input output 0 0 activities operating system overhead everything Computers are often shared however and a processor may work on several programs simultaneously In such cases the system may try to optimize through CPU execution time Also put rather than attempt to minimize the elapsed time for one program Hence we called CPU time The actual often want to distinguish between the elapsed time and the time that the proces time the CPU spends comput sor is working on our behalf CPU execution time or simply CPU time which ing for a specific task ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science260.txt

Computer_Science,488 Chapter 7 Large and Fast Exploiting Memory Hierarchy larger block sizes to be used while still maintaining alow miss penalty similar to that for a smaller block The processor is typically connected to memory over a bus The clock rate of the bus is usually much slower than the processor by as much as a fa ctor of 10 The speed of this bus affects the miss penalty To understand the impact of different organizations of memory let s define a set of hypothetical memory access times Assume 1 memory bus clock cycle to send the address 15 memory bus clock cycles for each DRAM access initiated 1 memory bus clock cycle to send a word of data If we have a cache block of four words and a one word wide bank of DRAMs the miss penalty would be 1 4 X 15 4 X 1 65 memory bus clock cycles Thus the number of bytes transferred per bus clock cycle for a single miss would be 4 x 4 0 25 65 Figure 7 11 shows three options for designing the memory system The first option follows what we have been assuming memory is one word wide and all accesses are made sequentially The second option increases the bandwidth to memory by widening the memory and the buses between the processor and mem ory this allows parallel access to all the words of the block The third option increases the bandwidth by widening the memory but not the interconnection bus Thus we still pay a cost to transmit each word but we can avoid paying the cost of the access latency more than once Let s look at how much these other two options improve the 65 cycle miss penalty that we would see for the first option Figure 7 11 a Increasing the width of the memory and the bus will increase the memory bandwidth proportionally decreasing both the access time and transfer time por tions of the miss penalty With a main memory width of two words the miss pen alty drops from 65 memory bus clock cycles to 1 2 X 15 2 X 1 33 memory bus clock cycles With a four word wide memory the miss penalty is just 17 memory bus clock cycles The bandwidth for a single miss is then 0 48 almost twice as high bytes per bus clock cycle for a memory that is two words wide and 0 94 bytes per bus clock cycle when the memory is four words wide almost four times higher The major costs of this enhancement are the wider bus and the potential increase in cache access time due to the multiplexor and control logic between the processor and cache Instead of making the entire path between the memory and cache wider the memory chips can be organized in banks to read or write multiple words in one,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science504.txt

Computer_Science,7 3 Measuring and Improving Cache Performance 495 3 44 77 4 44 Similarly increasing clock rate without changing the memory system also increases the performance lost due to cache misses as the next example shows Cache Performance with Increased Clock Rate Suppose we increase the performance of the computer in the previous exam EXAMPLE ple by doubling its clock rate Since the main memory speed is unlikely to change assume that the absolute time to handle a cache miss does not change How much faster will the computer be with the faster clock assum ing the same miss rate as the previous example Measured in the fa ster clock cycles the new miss penalty will be twice as ANSWER many clock cycles or 200 clock cycles Hence Total miss cycles per instruction 2 X 200 36 X 4 X 200 6 88 Thus the faster computer with cache misses will have a CPI of 2 6 88 8 88 compared to a CPI with cache misses of 5 44 for the slower computer Using the formula for CPU time from the previous example we can compute the relative performance as Performance with fa st clock Execution time with slow clock Performance with slow clock Execution time with fast clock IC X CPIslow dock X Clock cycle IC CPI Clock 9 cle X fast dock X 2 5 44 1 23 8 88 X Thus the computer with the fa ster clock is about 1 2 times faster rather than 2 times faster which it would have been if we ignored cache misses ,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science511.txt
Computer_Science,7 4 Virtual Memory 523 On every reference we look up the virtual page number in the TLB If we get a hit the physical page number is used to form the address and the corresponding reference bit is turned on If the processor is performing a write the dirty bit is also turned on If a miss in the TLB occurs we must determine whether it is a page fault or merely a TLB miss If the page exists in memory then the TLB miss indicates only that the translation is missing In such cases the processor can handle the TLB miss by loading the translation from the page table into the TLB and then trying the reference again If the page is not present in memory then the TLB miss indicates a true page fault In this case the processor invokes the operating system using an exception Because the TLB has many fewer entries than the number of pages in main memory TLB misses will be much more fre quent than true page faults TLB misses can be handled either in hardware or in software In practice with care there can be little performance difference between the two approaches because the basic operations are the same in either case After a TLB miss occurs and the missing translation has been retrieved from the page table we will need to select a TLB entry to replace Because the reference and dirty bits are contained in the TLB entry we need to copy these bits back to the page table entry when we replace an entry These bits are the only portion of the TLB entry that can be changed Using write back that is copying these entries back at miss time rather than when they are written is very efficient since we expect the TLB miss rate to be small Some systems use other techniques to approximate the reference and dirty bits eliminating the need to write into the TLB except to load a new table entry on a miss Some typical values for a TLB might be TLB size 16 5 12 entries Block size 1 2 page table entries typically 4 8 bytes each Hit time 0 5 1 clock cycle Miss penalty 10 100 clock cycles Miss rate 0 0 1 1 Designers have used a wide variety of associativities in TLBs Some systems use small fully associative TLBs because a fully associative mapping has a lower miss rate furthermore since the TLB is small the cost of a fully associative mapping is not too high Other systems use large TLBs often with small associativity With a fully associative mapping choosing the entry to replace becomes tricky since implementing a hardware LRU scheme is too expensive Furthermore since TLB misses are much more frequent than page faults and thus must be handled more cheaply we cannot afford an expensive software algorithm as we can for page,./data/Computer_Science/Computer_Science539.txt

History,xxxii 1950 to the Present overseas Most poor countries remained dependent on the export of low priced single crops such as coffee from Brazil bananas and other fruits from Central America and cocoa and peanuts from West Africa By the 21st century privatization and globalization had further lowered the prices of agricul tural products from nations in the Global South leading to greater rural poverty The United States and others also sought to export wheat hence in Mexico and other South American nations wheat bread gradually began to undermine the popularity of the traditional corn tortillas that provided more complete nutrients Similarly mothers in much of the Global South were encouraged to buy manufactured milk formulas rather than nursing their infants The degradation of the environment also made it harder for the rural poor to eke out livelihoods on depleted and deforested soils with insufficient water supplies In contrast heavy government subsidies and protectionist policies pro tected farmers and the agricultural sector in Europe North America and Australasia Technological and political developments led to the increase of food production and distribu tion in many regions Improved transportation and communication systems allowed food from rich agricultural nations especially the United States Canada and Australia to be distributed in poor regions International humanitarian aid organizations and aid benefits by rock stars and others helped to provide needed relief Scientific and technological advances and chemical fertilizers also increased the yields of vital grains per acre However the application of these developments was uneven Poor countries used the least amount of fertilizers ranging from 200 grams per hectare of arable land in the Central African Republic to 535 800 grams per hectare in South Korea Pesticide use was similarly uneven The green revolution begun in the 1960s introduced high yielding rice corn and wheat as a result of the use of these high yield crops the world s rice production doubled between 1967 and 1992 and India went from being a grain importing nation to an exporter of rice Harvests in Mexico and other nations also increased Thus formerly famine prone nations such as India Bangladesh China and Mexico were able to produce sufficient food to feed their growing populations although pockets of hunger and malnutrition remained By the 1990s scientists had also successfully geneti cally modified GM key crops and livestock to increase production Vast irrigation projects such as the Aswa n Dam in Egypt the Three Gorges Dam in China and the Atatürk Dam in Turkey also brought new land into agricultural production as well as generating electrical power for civilian use and industry Unfortunately these projects came at high ecological and human costs Some argued that smaller more technologically appropriate projects might have produced the same results at lower human and economic costs The development of new and less perishable foodstuffs was sometimes driven by wars or the military For example during World War II instant eggs and Spam were adopted as rations to feed troops After the war many in the West adopted these products as part of their usual diets The space program also contributed to the development of high energy drinks and dehydrated foods A wide variety of easily available and inexpensive frozen foods provided convenience to Western homemakers who eagerly fed TV dinners and other fast foods to their families These new food stuffs altered the eating habits of many in the West and freed homemakers mostly women from long hours spent in food preparation Fast food franchises proliferated from the West to Russia the Middle East India and China The wealthy around the world adopted Western eating styles and foodstuffs including soft drinks hamburgers and pizza Conversely Asian cuisine from India Thailand and China became popular in the United States and Europe Other new foodstuffs includ ing a wide variety of soft drinks were popular worldwide Health concerns especially among the middle and upper classes in the West contributed to the popularity of organic foods and eating locally grown products that were close to nature Many also adopted the Mediterranean diet heavy with fruits and vegetables with little meat The poor in the West and the rest of the world were generally unable to afford these more expensive foodstuffs or diets Hence although much of the world s population was better fed by the beginning of the 21st century people in Europe North America Japan and Australasia consumed about one third more ,./data/History/History_32.txt

Maths,Algebra and Geometry 187 Many mathematicians have constructed proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem Even non mathematicians have discovered new ways to prove this theorem In fact President Garfield published a proof of the Pythagorean Theorem back in 1876 One of the nice things about the Pythagorean Theorem is that it works both ways cid 96 Given any right triangle the lengths of the three sides satisfy the relationship a2 b2 c2 cid 96 If the lengths of the three sides of a triangle satisfy the equation a2 b2 c2 where a and b are the lengths of the shorter sides and c is the length of the longest side then the triangle is a right triangle The Pythagorean Theorem involves squaring lengths and solving for lengths by taking the square root of a number Remember that if a num ber is a perfect square its square root will be an integer Otherwise its square root will be an irrational number We can use a calculator to approximate the square root of a number that is not a perfect square and round to get estimates for these irrational numbers Example 1 If the lengths of the two legs of a right triangle are 5 inches and 12 inches find the length of the hypotenuse Solution Let c represent the length of the hypotenuse and use the Pythagorean Theorem to find c So the length of the hypotenuse is 13 inches Example 2 A right triangle has one leg that is three times longer than the other leg If the length of the hypotenuse is 10 inches find the lengths of the two legs ,./data/Maths/Math_187.txt

Maths,Inequalities and Graphs 145 that we are not allowed to do with equalities that we are allowed to do with inequalities The differences in how we treat equalities and inequali ties stems from the fact that equality is an equivalence relation whereas inequalities are not Lesson 8 2 Properties of Inequalities There are two ways that we can transform equations We can add or subtract the same number to both sides of the equality and we can multiply or divide both sides of the equation by the same number These transformations are allowed because of the addition property of equality and the multiplication property of equality Inequalities actually have two addition properties and a restricted multiplication property The first addition property of inequality states that if a b then a c b c To understand this property let s go back to our example with money Suppose I have 25 and you have 5 If someone gives us each 5 then I will still have more money than you I will have 30 and you will have 10 We will both be richer but I ll still be richer than you The second addition property of inequality states that if a b and c d then a c b d Again this is not surprising Suppose I have 25 and you have 5 If some kind person gives me 10 and you 5 then I will definitely still have more money than you The only thing you are not allowed to do is try to correct the inequal ity by trying to balance things out Either you give the same amount to both sides of the inequality the first addition property or you increase the imbalance by giving more to haves then you do to the have nots the second addition property You are not allowed to try to make up for any injustice by giving more to the have nots It may not seem fair but that s the way it is That s why they are called inequalities The restricted multiplication property of inequalities is also fairly clear It states that if a b and c 0 then a c b c The restriction that the number that you multiply by must be positive is very important and it is worth looking at in more detail Consider the inequality 0 1 Suppose that we wanted to multiply both sides of this inequality by a negative number let s multiply both sides of the inequality 0 1 by 1 On the left hand side of the inequality you would have 0 1 which is 0 On the right hand side of the inequal ity you would have 1 1 which is 1 Now how does 0 compare to 1 ,./data/Maths/Math_145.txt

Maths,Expressions and Equations 109 Lesson 6 3 Equality The concept of equality is an important idea and has very special properties worth examining in more detail It is used to relate seemingly distinct objects together and is called a relation A relation is something that compares two objects For example if I had 10 1 bills and you had a 10 bill then we would have an equal amount of money even though the form of our money is different If my son broke his piggy bank and discovered that he had 40 quarters he would have the same amount of money as we do This example helps illustrate three important properties of equality cid 96 Equality is reflexive This means that any object is equal to itself This idea is almost self evident To illustrate the reflexive property mathematically we write a a For example 5 5 cid 96 Equality is symmetric This means that if object A is equal to object B then object B is equal to object A This property emphasizes the fact that the order in which we equate objects doesn t matter It doesn t matter if object A appears on the left or the right hand side of the To state this idea mathematically we write If a b then b a For example if 3 4 12 then 12 3 4 cid 96 Equality is transitive This means that if object A is equal to object B and object B is equal to object C then object A is equal to object C Object B is just an intermediate object that can be eliminated in the comparison we can cut to the chase and set object A equal to object C This can be expressed mathematically as If a b and b c then a c For example if 10 5 50 and 50 25 2 then 10 5 25 2 Because these three properties are so important in mathematics we say that any relation that has all three of these properties is an equiva lence relation It is important to note that every equivalence relation has all three of these properties There are other relations besides equality that we will use later on that are not equivalence relations Those rela tions will be missing at least one of the three required properties ,./data/Maths/Math_109.txt

Maths,Homework Helpers Basic Math and Pre Algebra 110 Lesson 6 4 Algebraic Properties of Equality Equations represent balance and any change that you make to an equation must maintain that balance Maintaining that balance means that there are only certain things that you are allowed to do to an equa tion The key point is that whatever you do to one side of the equation you must also do to the other side of the equation You are not allowed to tip the scales and favor one side over another side The first algebraic property of equality is known as the addition property of equality It states that you are allowed to add the same amount to both sides of an equation Mathematically we write this prop erty as follows If a b and c are numbers with a b then a c b c We are not allowed to favor one side of the equality over the other side the quantity c was added to both sides so the balance is main tained Looking back on the example with money if you have a 10 bill and I have 10 1 bills then we each have the same amount of money If a kind stranger gives us each a 20 bill then we are both still equally rich we both have a total of 30 Notice that in the addi tion property of equality the signs of a b and c were not specified That s because it doesn t matter If I have 10 1 bills and my son has 40 quarters and we both decide to spend 2 on an ice cream cone then we will both end up with 8 The addition property of equality is important because it allows us to add or subtract the same number from both sides of an equation without changing the validity of that statement The second algebraic property of equality is known as the multiplica tion property of equality It states that you are allowed to multiply both sides of an equality by the same amount Mathematically we write this property as follows If a b and c are numbers with a b then a c b c Again one side is not favored over the other side both sides are treated equally because both sides are being multiplied by c Let s go back to our example with money If you have a 10 bill and I have 10 1 bills and we both double our money in a bet then we both now have 20 www ebook3000 com,./data/Maths/Math_110.txt

Maths,Numbers 31 Lesson 1 9 Variables and the Distributive Property We are starting to talk about the properties of numbers in general Some numbers are prime others are composite Some numbers are even others are odd Talking about numbers in general can be awkward We need a symbol to represent any number The symbols we use to write specific numbers such as 5 cannot be used to represent any number A symbol that is used to represent any number is called a variable We can use anything other than a number as a variable We could use letters at the beginning of the alphabet such as a b or c to serve as a variable We could use letters at the end of the alphabet such as x y or z to serve as a variable We could use a happy face or a star to serve as a variable The important thing is that a variable cannot be a number Let me show you one way a variable can be used If I say Let a represent any counting number then a could be any number from our list 1 2 3 4 If I wanted to describe the multiplicative property of 0 remember that special property 0 times any number is 0 I use the symbol a to represent any number and write 0 a 0 We can also use variables to make general statements about num bers We invented multiplication as a shorthand notation for addition We noticed that 3 3 3 3 can be shortened to 4 3 This shorthand notation is not specific to the number 3 Any number added to itself 4 times can be written as 4 times that number This is awkward to express using words but it is easy to express using variables If a is any number then a a a a 4 a The multiplication symbol is usually omitted and we write 4a instead of 4 a Whenever you see a number and a variable next to each other with nothing in between them you should imagine a multiplication symbol between them The expression 3a means the same thing as 3 times a or 3 a The number in front of the vari able is called the coefficient of the variable and it represents how many times the variable is added to itself Now that we know what 3a and 4a mean let s examine what 3a 4a means We can write out what 3a and 4a each mean and go from there 3a a a a and 4a a a a a so 3a 4a means a a a a a a a This is just a added to itself 7 times or 7a Notice that 3a 4a 7a Instead of writing out all of the a s in the sum it is easier just to add the coefficients of the variable together and write this new coefficient in front of the variable You will see more examples of variables later on in this lesson and I wanted you to be prepared ,./data/Maths/Math_31.txt
Maths,Numbers 25 A smaller number is a factor of a larger number if when you divide the smaller number into the larger number you end up with a remainder of 0 It is called a factor because you can multiply it by the quotient to get the larger number Remember that multiplication and division go hand in hand For example 4 is a factor of 20 because 20 4 equals 5 remainder 0 Looking at it another way 4 5 20 We say that 20 is evenly divisibly by 4 Every number is evenly divisibly by its factors Divides evenly means the same thing as has remainder 0 Every counting number is evenly divisible by 1 and every counting number is evenly divisible by itself Lesson 1 7 Prime Numbers and Factoring A counting number is prime if the only numbers that divide into it evenly are 1 and itself In other words a prime number has no other factors besides 1 and itself For example 3 is prime because the only numbers that divide it evenly are 1 and 3 Remember that every counting number other than 1 has at least two factors 1 and itself Because the number 1 divides evenly into every other counting number we call 1 a trivial factor The number 1 is in a class by itself There is only one counting num ber that evenly divides 1 itself It is not considered to be prime If a counting number other than 1 is not prime it is composite A composite number is a number that can be evenly divided by a number other than 1 or itself For example 9 is composite because in addition to 1 and 9 it is evenly divisible by 3 We can list the first few prime numbers 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 The list of prime numbers never ends There is no largest prime number Over the years many mathematicians have been and continue to be fascinated with prime numbers and new discoveries about prime num bers are still being made The largest prime number known requires more than 4 million digits to write out completely and mathematicians are currently looking for an even larger prime number Prime numbers are useful for factoring numbers Every composite number can be written as a product of prime numbers For example 18 2 3 3 and 2 and 3 are prime numbers In order to factor a composite number you need to go down the list of prime numbers divide each prime number into the composite number and check to see if the remainder is zero If the remainder is 0 the prime number you used is a factor of the composite number ,./data/Maths/Math_25.txt

Maths,Linear Functions and Graphs 161 Relations can also be specified by writing a formula and using vari ables to represent the input and the output A formula gives a set of specific instructions about what to do with the input value A formula is an equation where one side of the equal sign is the dependent variable and the other side of the equal sign consists of an algebraic expression that only involves the independent variable For example if x represents the input of our relation or independent variable and y represents the output or the dependent variable of our relation the formula y 2x 1 specifies a relation between x and y You could use this formula to calcu late the output for various values of the input Having a formula enables you to completely describe a relation without having to list every single ordered pair in the relation Relations that are described using words are very important in apply ing mathematics to our everyday lives For example if your cellular phone plan costs 35 per month for up to 300 minutes and 39 cents for every minute over 300 you can use this relationship to calculate your monthly phone bill Relations can be described graphically The graph of a relation helps you visualize that relation so that you can understand its properties more thoroughly For example you could look at a graph of the price of a particular stock over time and decide whether to buy more shares of that stock A function is similar to a relation in that it is a rule that establishes a relationship between two quantities and has an input and an output The input is still called the domain and the output is still called the range or the co domain The variable used to describe the elements in the domain is called the independent variable and the variable used to describe the elements in the range is called the dependent variable But there s more to a function than there is to a relation With a relation the same input value could result in two different output values With a function this is not allowed The feature that dis tinguishes a function from a relation is that with a function each input value is assigned a unique output value We tend to focus on functions more than relations because of this extra stipulation It is easy to become attached to algebraic expressions and give them names I told you in the beginning of this chapter that as soon as you name an algebraic expression a function is born Unfortunately mathematicians aren t very clever with their names y and ƒ x are the most common ,./data/Maths/Math_161.txt

Maths,Homework Helpers Basic Math and Pre Algebra 164 ordered pair a b We have already talked about how the number line can be used to graph a number In order to graph an ordered pair a b we will need to be able to graph two numbers simultaneously To graph an ordered pair you will need to use one number line for the input and another number line for the output If you arrange these two number lines so that they are perpendicular to each other as is shown in Figure 9 1 you will have created what is known as the Cartesian coor dinate system The Cartesian coordinate system is named for Rene Descartes who is credited with inventing it This coordinate system brings geometry and algebra together enabling us to use algebra to solve prob lems in geometry and to use geometry y axis to gain insight into algebraic results We use this system which is sometimes called the coordinate plane to locate points and draw figures 2 The horizontal number line is called the x axis and it is used to record the values of the input or in x axis dependent variable or the first num ber in the ordered pair a b The vertical number line is called the y axis 2 and it is used to record the function values or the output or the values of the dependent variable or the second number in the ordered pair a b We Figure 9 1 will draw the two number lines so that they intersect at 0 the point where the two lines intersect is called the origin The ordered pair corresponding to the origin is 0 0 Two numbers are used to describe the location of a point in the plane and they are recorded as an ordered pair x y where the first number represents the horizontal distance from the y axis to the point and the second number represents the vertical distance from the x axis to the point The first coordinate is called the x coordinate and the second coordinate is called the y coordinate Points that are on the x axis have a y coordinate equal to 0 and points that are on the y axis have their x coordinate equal to 0 Those points that lie to the right of the y axis have a positive x coordinate and points to the left of the y axis have a negative x coordinate Similarly points www ebook3000 com,./data/Maths/Math_164.txt
